# Meet with Jennifer Klunk

[Meeting Link]()

## [[2021-09-22]]

### Questions

- Skeletal/site dating of Danish individuals (Ex. `individual_metadata.xlsx`)
- Suggestions for Figure 3. There are 3 points I wanted to show:
	1. The genomic evidence and historical evidence aligns regarding the timeline of plague in Denmark.
		- No Yp found in the century before and preceding historical evidence.


	-  Of the sampled sites.regions, plague is thought to be present from 1350-1650.
	-  We sampled this period, but also the century previous and the century after.
	-  We only find plague in periods where this is historical evidence of it's presence.
	- We sampled before, during, and after 
- 


### Notes

- Just both Julia once!
- Link together the arm position figure with the timeline
- Go check Jen's cMYC screening!
- Meet with People about timeline phylogeny again?
- Our current narratives are very different from 10 years ago, what stories will be telling in another 10 years?
- pla depletion, what is the narrative on the paper, does this fit in in or is shoehorned?
- Ypestis DNA giving insight to the archaeological record, no mass burials
- undocumented Black Death (Tirup, G371)
- Urbanization, Viking and Medieval Denmark from Landing Place
- Yp denmark, how interconnected it was in the disease experience, even rural places!
- genetic diversity -> individual/site diversity mortuary practices -> all part of the same disease experience, but also not a monolithic disease experience
- black death as a very unique historical/genetic event.
- genetic diversity -> multiple epidemics or diversity within an epidemic
- why does it matter? lack of written records, connection of disease experiences, unique study design, one location over time
- expanding overall geographic expanse, density, but also temporal density
- originally bd (england), from Asia, root of polytomy, then multiple samples from France was monophyletic, reservoirs, endemic in some regions?
- If you sample across medieval period, you will find plague
- The ubiquity of plague across the Second Pandemic
- Is there a genome from Cambridge
- Think about the Baltic-Alps clade and reservoirs theories of Philip Slavin
- The ubiquity of plague in medieval Denmark
- Epidemiological breakpoints, tying in with the historical data
- Synthesizing what came before is just as important as singular new data

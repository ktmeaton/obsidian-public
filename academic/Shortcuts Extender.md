# Shortcuts Extender

## Summary

Shortcuts Extender adds additional shortcuts to [[Obsidian]].

## Functions

### Changing the Heading Level
> To change the heading level of the text, just place the cursor on the line whose heading level we want to change. Use keyboard shortcuts to specify the heading level:
>-  <`Ctrl` + `1`\> for heading1
>-   <`Ctrl` + `2`\> for heading2
>-   <...>
>-   <`Ctrl` + `6`\> for heading6

### Clearing the markup of the selected text

> Use `Ctrl` + `0` for clearing the markup of the selected text: only the initial characters of lines are cleared, such as markup characters for headings, numbered and unnumbered lists, quotes.
> You can in this way both clear the markup in the drain, where the pointer is at the current moment, and clear the markup of lines from all the selected text.

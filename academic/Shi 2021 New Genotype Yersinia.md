## Summary

### Findings

- The wild plague foci in [[Yulong County]], China has recently expanded southward along the Hengduan mountain range into [[Heqing County]].
- Isolates from this new foci were attenuated in their hosts, as no _Y. pestis_ was isolated from sick/dead animals in this region.
- Variant analysis (both SNP and structural) found no obvious functional differences that could explain this virulence change.
- However, transcriptome analysis revealed up-regulation of iron-transfer genes.
- Because the new foci is at a higher altitude, the authors hypothesize that hosts have lower iron concentrations. So the bacteria had to adapt (up-regulate) its ability to acquire iron.
- This reminds me ([[Katherine Eaton|Kat]]) of how the vaccine strains (EV76 and KIM) are avirulent because they've lost the _pgm_ locus, which is involved in iron acquisition.
- **Rav**: anything iron-related in your pPCP1/_pla_ study?

### Data

- _[[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]]_ strains were attenuated to their host in the new local region.
- 20 [[Yersinia pestis]] genomes from [[Yunnan]] China.
- 10 high-virulence isolates from [[Yulong County]], [[Lijiang City]]: 2006 - 2018
- 10 low-virulence isolates from [[Heqing County]], [[Dali Prefecture]]: 2017

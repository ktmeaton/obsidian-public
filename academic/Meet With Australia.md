# Meet With Australia

## [[2021-05-06]] 1800 EST / 0800 AEST

### Summary

- When estimating a [[Substitution Rate]] for all of *[[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]]*, a [[Clock Model|strict clock]] and [[Clock Model|relaxed clock]] produce different estimates (ie. non-overlapping distributions).
- [[Clock Model#Relaxed Clock|Relaxed clock]] [[MCMC]] runs produce a high [[Coefficient of Variation]] indicating a relaxed model is favored over a strict model.  However, these runs do not converge, suggesting there is too much [[rate variation]] to confidently estimate key parameters such as the mean [[Substitution Rate]] or [[MRCA|tMRCA]].
- Inspecting a [[Root to Tip Regression]] separated by [[Clades]] suggests there might be temporal signal. A [[Bayesian Evaluation of Temporal Signal]] ([[Bayesian Evaluation of Temporal Signal|BETS]]) confirms this and is  much more sensitive than a [[Regression]].
- There is little use in [[Dating]] the full [[Phylogenetic|phylogeny]] of *[[Y. pestis]]*, either in it's entirety (N=~600) or a reduced subsample (N=~200).
- [[Discrete]] [[phylogeography]] will be attempted on the [[Clade]] dataset.
- This paper is currently composed of three datasets:

| Name    | Size  | Composition        | Purpose                                           |
| ------- | ----- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Full    | N=600 | All                | Alignment, maximum-likelihood phylogeny.          |
| Reduced | N=200 | Subsampled         | Demonstrate [[Dating\|dating]] instability        |
| Clade   | N=600 | Separated by clade | [[Dating]] and [[Phylogeography\|phylogeography]] |

### Tasks

- [ ] [[Katherine Eaton]] | [[Create geographic traits file by Clade]].
- [ ] [[Katherine Eaton]] | [[Plague Phylodynamics and Phylogeography Outline]].
- [ ] [[Sebastian Duchene]] | [[Run BETS on all Clades]].

### Next Meeting

- [[Meet With Australia#2021-05-13 1800 EST 0800 AEST]]

### Notes

#### Full Dataset (full)

- N=601, (600+Reference) to be used to construct the master [[Alignment]] and estimate a [[Maximum-likelihood]] tree to contextualize the [[Clade]] dataset.

#### Reduced Dataset (prune)

**Note**:  Ultimately decided the [[Dating]] analysis on this dataset would not be used beyond showing analytical/statistical instability.

- Fixing the tree helped, but the [[Marginal|marginal]] [[Likelihood|likelihoods]]  were still a problem
- [[Coefficient of Variation]] does not support a [[Clock Model#Strict Clock|strict clock]].
	![[Coefficient of Variation.png|400]]
- A [[Clock Model#Strict Clock|strict clock]] and [[Clock Model#Relaxed Clock|relaxed clock]] have overlapping distributions with similar peaks for the [[Tree Height]] (blue: strict, green: relaxed).
	![[Tree Height Comparison.png|300]]
- A [[Clock Model#Strict Clock|strict clock]] and [[Clock Model#Relaxed Clock|relaxed clock]] have non-overlapping distributions for the mean [[Substitution Rate]] (green: strict, orange: relaxed).
	![[Substitution Rate Comparison.png|300]]
- There doesn't appear to be clustering of rates. Branches with high rates are next to those with low rates.
	![[Time Tree Colored by Rate.png|400]]

#### [[Clade]] Dataset
- ```has_signal``` is the [[Bayes Factor]] for having [[Clock Model|temporal signal]], [[BETS]].
	![[Clade Dating Statistics Table.png]]
- We noticed that some of the [[MRCA]] dates do not make sense. [[Sebastian Duchene|Sebastian]] realized this is due to an error in the [[R]] code with [[Tree Height]] scaling.

##### [[Continuous]]

1. Experimented with [[Continuous|continuous]] [[Phylogeography|phylogeography]] in [[BEAST2]].

### Notes

- Set up different priors on the mean rate
- No good mixing for the relaxed clock, for many of the parameters
- High values for the coefficient of variation (high rate variation)
- Fitting the rate variation to a model is really hard!	
- Strict clock: Setting different priors ends up the with similar/overlapping distributions. Not sensitive to prior!
- How do rates differ between strict and relaxed? Very different!
- Root heights differ (20,000 - 8,000 YBP)
- Need to make a lot of assumptions 

### Tasks
- [x] [[Send Starting Tree to Australia]]
- [x] [[Create Multiple Alignments by Clade]]
- [x] [[Send IBD Plots]]
- Dating by clade (BETS analysis).
- Relative branch rates (genetic distance, 
- Relaxed clock, fit rate to 1, for phylogeography
- Visualized as a matrix
- Leave one out analysis
- BETS -> 	Leave One Out

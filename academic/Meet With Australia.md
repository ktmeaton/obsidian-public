# Meet With Australia

## [[2021-05-06]]

[Meeting Link](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/84756536944?pwd=YWFMaTRJZ24wYVlxQ01ZckRFcUdadz09)

### Preparation

- Discuss the Big Bang Polytomy dating.
- Phylogeography subsampling
- [Second Pandemic Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/community/ktmeaton/plague-phylogeography-projects@main/main/full/1.PRE?branchLabel=Province%20Confidence&c=clade_rtt_dist&m=div&tl=country) 

### Notes

- Fixing the tree helped, but estimated Marginal likelihood still a problem.
- Coefcient of variation: tandard deviation of branch lengths divided by the mean. Does not support a fixed clock!
- Blue: Strict, Green: Relaxed. Treeheight is overlapping, but different variation
- Non-overlapping for strict and relaxed (yellow is relaxed, difficult to get good mixing)
- Theory, there's a few branches that have really high rates. Branches with high rates are next to branches with low rates.
- Testing local clocks 
- "has_signal", Bayse Factor for having temporal signal, BETS
- Reported rate for each clade.

- Send geo names for each sample.
- Go look at the BETS paper comparing to regressions, restating those points

### Preparation

#### 1. Datasets
1. Constructed two datasets based on samples that have [[Geographic Location]] and [[Date]]:
	- Full (n=600)
	- Reduced (n=200)

#### 2. [[Clock Model]]

##### Regression

#### 3. [[Phylogeography]]

##### [[Continuous]]

1. Experimented with [[Continuous|continuous]] [[Phylogeography|phylogeography]] in [[BEAST2]].

### Notes

- Set up different priors on the mean rate
- No good mixing for the relaxed clock, for many of the parameters
- High values for the coefficient of variation (high rate variation)
- Fitting the rate variation to a model is really hard!	
- Strict clock: Setting different priors ends up the with similar/overlapping distributions. Not sensitive to prior!
- How do rates differ between strict and relaxed? Very different!
- Root heights differ (20,000 - 8,000 YBP)
- Need to make a lot of assumptions 

### Tasks
- [x] [[Send Starting Tree to Australia]]
- [x] [[Create Multiple Alignments by Clade]]
- [x] [[Send IBD Plots]]
- 
- Dating by clade (BETS analysis).
- Relative branch rates (genetic distance, 
- Relaxed clock, fit rate to 1, for phylogeography
- Visualized as a matrix
- Leave one out analysis


- BETS -> 	Leave One Out

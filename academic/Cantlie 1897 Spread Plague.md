## Summary

> _"What determines the distribution it is impossible to say. ... It seems to thrive in the densely packed population of Canton and in the sparsely populated semi-desert regions of Rajputana and Arabia; the elevated plateau of Thibet and the low-lying valleys of the Euphrates are equally affected. It occurs during the summer's heat and the winter's snows. In fact, no known meteorological condition has any effect upon either the genesis or the exodus of plague."_ (p. 18)

>_"As animals are affected, it is interesting to inquire what animals are affected, what is their geographical distribution, and what share, if any, they take in its spread. The animal which above all others is known to be affected by plague is the rat; but the wide geographical area throughout which this animal is met would seem to frustrate any attempt to determine a collateral distribution."_ (p. 18)

> _"With regard to the continuity of plague outbreaks it would appear that in the plague belt the disease is ever active, now in one place and now in another. At times we find it in Arabia, then in Persia and the Himalayas, and the wave travels eastwards over Yunnan and Southern China to the sea. The disease oscillates, now east and now west, but with a fatal precision, making the slow swing of the pendulum of plague within a fairly definite area."_

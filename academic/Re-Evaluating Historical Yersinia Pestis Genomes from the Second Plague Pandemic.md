# Re-Evaluating Historical Yersinia Pestis Genomes from the Second Plague Pandemic

POTENTIAL SLIDES:

1. [[Hendrik Poinar\|Henrik]] | Plague has a complicated ecology
2. [[Hendrik Poinar\|Henrik]] |  Plague has different rates of replication, enzootic, epizootic, epidemic. Define mutation vs substitution rate and can we see rate differences across a tree?
3. [[Hendrik Poinar\|Henrik]] | Explain the time dependency of molecular rates and why rates change over time. How this may be linked to plague ecology.

4. [x] [[Katherine Eaton\|Kat]] | We can reconstruct trees from shared strains of human and rodents (K) Full tree from your existing data. *ASIDE- I still think it’s worth the investment to try and link host to your database*
	> "So how do we begin to untangle this complex, multi-host ecology? One option is to estimate the evolutionary relationships between strains of plague with a phylogenetic tree. For example, we know that plague has made its way into Europe at least 4 times in the past. And these pandemics have been *unique* emergences (or 'spillover' events) from rodents into human populations. "

5. [x] [[Katherine Eaton\|Kat]] | Host Comparison
	> "*It's important to remember that plague is primarily a disease of rodents, NOT humans. And it crosses the species barrier frequently and easily. Thus [[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]] rarely forms host-specific clusters. The anomalies to this are ancient epidemics (yellow clades) and that reflects the sampling strategy of working with skeletal human remains rather than the TRUE ecology.*"
	> TBD: Create a mirrored subtree that shows rates.

6.  [x] [[Katherine Eaton\|Kat]] | Rate Comparison
	> "*This ability to be a generalist mammalian pathogen means that [[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]] has to constantly adapt. One way we see this is reconstructing the rate of evolution, or the speed in which mutations occur. As we would expect based on the previous tree, there is little clustering of rates (there are no obvious groups with fast or slow rates).*"
	> *Note: The units of rate are substitutions/year (rather than the substitutions/site/year which are extremely small numbers in scientific notation)*

8. [x] [[Katherine Eaton\|Kat]] | Regressions across the clades (I believe you have these already) - maybe the modern pandemic, 2nd, 1st and Bronze Age? Point being - despite the variation there is temporal signal which can be used to address dates on nodes? 
	> *"This pattern of constant host-switching and rate variation makes it extremely challenging to fit a [[Molecular Clock]]. Which is to say we want to create a model for how mutations accrue over time, so that we can infer the timing of past events. However! If we take a closer look, some clades do have strong temporal signal like the Second Pandemic. While others do not, like the Modern Pandemic."*

9. [ ] [[Katherine Eaton\|Kat]] | Show tmrca  for clades with clocks (maybe 1 without - ORI-1) , what does that say about dates of polytomys -and how we interpret ‘origins’. here the point is that they are still wide *show CIs and talk about why that’s important for this history.
	> "*One application is to estimate when these pandemics or clades may have began. In the case of the Second Pandemic, which has temporal signal, molecular dates suggest this clade originates in the 14th century which is congruent with historical evidence. In contrast the Modern Pandemic, which has poor temporal signal, is estimated to originate in the 16th century, which we know is incorrect!

10. [x] [[Katherine Eaton\|Kat]] | Show variation on the Big Bang polytomy as a result
> This means that we can date certain clades with confidence and others with very low confidence. Even more tricky is dating when clades diverged, like the Big Bang Polytomy.

10. [[Hendrik Poinar\|Henrik]] | show MY map with arrows and why this is problematic. Define ascertainment bias.
11. [[Hendrik Poinar\|Henrik]] | show Cui et al paper and the ‘Chinese’ origin of plague scenario. Other possible maps that are useless (Bramanti et al).

14. [x] [[Katherine Eaton\|Kat]]
	> "*Phylogeography has exciting potential, but we must be extremely cautious in our analysis and interpretations for three reasons:*
	> 1. Rapid [[Spread|spread]] with little genetic change. Samples from the [[Black Death]] (14th century, dark blue) are nearly identical. The order of divergence and thus directionality of movement, cannot be estimated confidently."
	> 2. Genomic data is sparsely sampled with significant [[Sampling Bias]]. In the case of [[Pestis Segunda]], a migration event can be estimate from the Netherlands back to Russia. However, this is based on 4 samples, and the [[Second Pandemic]] has a strong [[Western Europe]] bias.

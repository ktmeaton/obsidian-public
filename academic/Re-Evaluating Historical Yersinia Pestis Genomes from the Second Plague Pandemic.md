# Re-Evaluating Historical Yersinia Pestis Genomes from the Second Plague Pandemic

POTENTIAL SLIDES:

1. [[Hendrik Poinar\|Henrik]] | Plague has a complicated ecology
2. [[Hendrik Poinar\|Henrik]] |  Plague has different rates of replication, enzootic, epizootic, epidemic. Define mutation vs substitution rate and can we see rate differences across a tree?
3. [[Hendrik Poinar\|Henrik]] | Explain the time dependency of molecular rates and why rates change over time. How this may be linked to plague ecology.

4. [x] [[Katherine Eaton\|Kat]] | We can reconstruct trees from shared strains of human and rodents (K) Full tree from your existing data. *ASIDE- I still think it’s worth the investment to try and link host to your database*
	> "So how do we begin to untangle this complex, multi-host ecology? One option is to estimate the evolutionary relationships between strains of plague with a phylogenetic tree. For example, we know that plague has made its way into Europe at least 4 times in the past. And these pandemics have been *unique* emergences (or 'spillover' events) from rodents into human populations. "

5. [ ] [[Katherine Eaton\|Kat]] | Can we zoom in on a clade or branch, where you DO have host information - with some (a few) known rodent strains embedded in the tree so I can show that the tree contains both mixed signals?
	> "*It's important to remember that plague is primarily a disease of rodents, NOT humans. And it crosses the species barrier frequently and easily. Thus [[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]] rarely forms host-specific clusters. The anomalies to this are ancient epidemics (yellow clades) and that reflects the sampling strategy of working with skeletal human remains rather than the TRUE ecology.*"
	> TBD: Create a mirrored subtree that shows rates.

6.  [x] [[Katherine Eaton\|Kat]] | Rainbow tree - with clear rate variation differences with graph to show the coefficient of variation. 
	> "*This ability to be a generalist mammalian pathogen means that [[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]] has to constantly adapt. One way we see this is reconstructing the rate of evolution, or the speed in which mutations occur. As we would expect based on the previous tree, there is little clustering of rates (there are no obvious groups with fast or slow rates).*"

7. [x] Maybe figure to show that rates are NOT easily categorized along human and mixed host samples. Maybe Sebastian’s tree showing both high and low rates across the tree would suffice. Maybe showing rate variation within the second pandemic clades would be interesting too (?),  showing that even within what’s presumed to be a human specific pandemic there are variations in rates (K- doable?).
	> REMOVE
	> I think the previous figure addresses this?

8. [ ] [[Katherine Eaton\|Kat]] | Regressions across the clades (I believe you have these already) - maybe the modern pandemic, 2nd, 1st and Bronze Age? Point being - despite the variation there is temporal signal which can be used to address dates on nodes? 
	> "*This pattern of constant host-switching and rate variation makes it extremely challenging to fit a [[Molecular Clock]]. Which is to say we want to create a model for how mutations accrue over time, so that we can infer the timing of past events. However! If we focus on clades and pandemics, a clearer pattern of evolution over time emerges. With this finding, we have greater power to make historical inferences.*"
	> TBD: Change this to 1.PRE vs. 2.MED

9. [ ] [[Katherine Eaton\|Kat]] | Show tmrca  for clades with clocks (maybe 1 without - ORI-1) , what does that say about dates of polytomys -and how we interpret ‘origins’. here the point is that they are still wide *show CIs and talk about why that’s important for this history.
	> "*One application is to estimate when these pandemics or clades may have began. In the case of the Bronze Age, this is also dating the first known emergence of plague in a human population. In the case of pandemics, we can infer the timing of precursor events that set them in motion.*
	> 
	> *The following graphs show 95% confidence intervals on when the root of each clade was.*"
	> TBD: Change this to subtree

10. [[Hendrik Poinar\|Henrik]] | show MY map with arrows and why this is problematic. Define ascertainment bias.
11. [[Hendrik Poinar\|Henrik]] | show Cui et al paper and the ‘Chinese’ origin of plague scenario. Other possible maps that are useless (Bramanti et al).

14. [ ] [[Katherine Eaton\|Kat]]
	> "*Phylogeography has exciting potential, but we must be extremely cautious in our analysis and interpretations for three reasons:*
	> 1. Methods assume that absence of evidence is evidence of absence.
	> 2. Genomic data is sparsely sampled with significant [[Sampling Bias]]. In the case of [[Pestis Segunda]], a migration event can be estimate from the Netherlands back to Russia. However, this is based on 4 samples, and the [[Second Pandemic]] has a strong [[Western Europe]] bias.
	> 3. Rapid [[Spread|spread]] with little genetic change. Samples from the [[Black Death]] (14th century, dark blue) are nearly identical. The order of divergence and thus directionality of movement, cannot be estimated confidently."
	> TBD: Add substitutions as branch labels (internal and terminal)
	> TBD: Fix clade labelling.

# Re-Evaluating Historical Yersinia Pestis Genomes from the Second Plague Pandemic

POTENTIAL SLIDES:

1. [[Hendrik Poinar\|Henrik]] | Plague has a complicated ecology
2. [[Hendrik Poinar\|Henrik]] |  Plague has different rates of replication, enzootic, epizootic, epidemic. Define mutation vs substitution rate and can we see rate differences across a tree?
3. [[Hendrik Poinar\|Henrik]] | Explain the time dependency of molecular rates and why rates change over time. How this may be linked to plague ecology.
4. [[Hendrik Poinar\|Henrik]] | We can reconstruct trees from shared strains of human and rodents (K) Full tree from your existing data. *ASIDE- I still think it‚Äôs worth the investment to try and link host to your database*
	- [[Katherine Eaton\|Kat]] | Can we zoom in on a clade or branch, where you DO have host information - with some (a few) known rodent strains embedded in the tree so I can show that the tree contains both mixed signals?
5.  [[Katherine Eaton\|Kat]] | Rainbow tree - with clear rate variation differences with graph to show the coefficient of variation. 
6. (?) Maybe figure to show that rates are NOT easily categorized along human and mixed host samples. Maybe Sebastian‚Äôs tree showing both high and low rates across the tree would suffice. Maybe showing rate variation within the second pandemic clades would be interesting too (?),  showing that even within what‚Äôs presumed to be a human specific pandemic there are variations in rates (K- doable?).
7. [[Katherine Eaton\|Kat]] | Regressions across the clades (I believe you have these already) - maybe the modern pandemic, 2nd, 1st and Bronze Age? Point being - despite the variation there is temporal signal which can be used to address dates on nodes? 
8. [[Katherine Eaton\|Kat]] | Show tmrca  for clades with clocks (maybe 1 without - ORI-1) , what does that say about dates of polytomys -and how we interpret ‚Äòorigins‚Äô. here the point is that they are still wide *show CIs and talk about why that‚Äôs important for this history.
9. [[Hendrik Poinar\|Henrik]] | show MY map with arrows and why this is problematic. Define ascertainment bias.
10. [[Hendrik Poinar\|Henrik]] | show Cui et al paper and the ‚ÄòChinese‚Äô origin of plague scenario. Other possible maps that are useless (Bramanti et al).
11. [[Katherine Eaton\|Kat]] | Show Kat‚Äôs current distribution of samples (map)
12. [[Katherine Eaton\|Kat]] | Show the bronze age clade and then one with reconstruction of the node when country as a label is used and then one when county is used? (* criticism to this point is why would one use less specific data to begin with? Wouldn‚Äôt we always rely on specific localized data, rather than more generalized ?) I wish we could do this for the second pandemic clade instead

# 2021-03-30 Scratch

Today I'm going to continue working on [[Sampling Bias Experiment]] in preparation for my meeting with [[Hendrik Poinar]].

## [[Sampling Bias Experiment]]

I did some testing of trying to do nice [[midpoint]] [[root|rerooting]] with [[biopython]]. In the end, doing [[root|rerooting]] manually in [[FigTree]] after [[IQTREE]] and before the parse-tree step worked for now.

I've done testing with [[BEAST]] to think through this experiment in more depth. I decided to add [[BEAST]] and [[beagle-lib]] to the [[plague-phylogeography]] [[conda]] environment. It's working well on windows, but for long chains I'd like to run it on [[Infoserv]].

# *pla* Depletion

A defining characteristic of plague in the post-Black Death period is the depletion of a key virulence factor,  the *plasminogen activator* (*pla*) on the pPCP1 plasmid. Previous work has identified the presence of *pla*+ and *pla*- plasmids co-existing in post-Black Death samples ([[Susat 2020 Yersinia Pestis Strains|Susat et al. 2020]]). A re-analysis of publicly available genomes reiterates these results, and reveals two clusters that can be easily distinguished when the sequencing depth of the *pla* gene is compared to the sequencing depth of the *pst* gene, which is also found on the pPCP1 plasmid (Figure 1). This depletion event is first observed in strain STA0001 from Germany (1390 - 1476) and is perpetuated in all subsequent strains, with the exception of Gdansk8 from Poland (1461 - 1523) and Rostov2033 from Russia (1762 - 1773). In these two outlier genomes, the *pla*+ plasmid is possibly restored as the dominant variant or the *pla*- plasmid is lost. 

Empirical results in a mouse model suggest that *pla*âˆ’ mutants are capable of flea-borne transmission, but the transmissibility is reduced ([[Sebbane 2006 Role Yersinia Pestis|Sebbane et al. 2006]]). Furthermore, *pla*- mutants were incapable of causing bubonic plague but still caused low incidences of primary septicemic plague. This variant also increased the time from infection to terminal disease from 2-5 days in *pla*+ strains to 4-12 days in *pla*- strains. From these studies, we hypothesize that ancient *Yersinia pestis* during this period may have caused a less transmissible disease, with slower progression, and different symptoms than experienced in previous centuries.

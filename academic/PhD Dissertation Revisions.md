	- [x] Page 3 - first line - we didn’t reconstruct the ‘entire’ genome. It’s a biased draft genome based on our bait set, which had problems!
	- [x] Page 14, last line. How will you be able to use your results to impact prospective studies of plague? Add in a line or two, otherwise seems like pandering…
	- [x] Page 17 point 3 under 3.3.2 - what’s a ‘true’ age?
	- [x] Page 21 - second paragraph, odd editing around Black Death
	- [x] Page 27. Third paragraph, first line. You claim that plague re-emerged during the 3rd pandemic. Isn’t this anti to what you’ve said earlier on descendant - ancestor relationship between 2nd and 3rd pandemic?
	- [x] Page 28 figure 9 caption. You state that “ Arrows reflect inferred migrations from one location to another but do not represent routes of spread” - huh?
	- [x] Page 37 figure 19 caption. The number of individuals totalled in panel A cannot possible be the 298 you sampled from Denmark for this study. Are these ALL samples you EVER sampled while imprisoned at the Poinar lab for plague??? Please change or make clear.

# Zhu et al. (2013) SRAdb: Query and Use Public next-Generation Sequencing Data from within R

## Summary

> Automatically created by [`seldon`](https://github.com/ktmeaton/seldon).

- The [[SRA|Sequence Read Archive]] (SRA) is the largest public repository of sequencing data from the next generation of sequencing platforms including Illumina (Genome Analyzer, HiSeq, MiSeq, .etc), Roche 454 GS System, Applied Biosystems SOLiD System, Helicos Heliscope, PacBio RS, and others.
- High throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are very rapidly becoming standard tools in biology.
- [[@zhu2013SRAdbQueryUse|SRAdb]] Bioconductor package provides a convenient and integrated framework to query and access SRA metadata quickly and powerfully from within R. 
- [[@zhu2013SRAdbQueryUse|SRAdb]] is an attempt to make queries of the metadata associated with SRA submission, study, sample, experiment and run more robust and precise, and make access to sequencing data in the SRA easier.
- Retrieving data Ô¨Åle information Searching [[SRA]] metadata using the [[@zhu2013SRAdbQueryUse|SRAdb]] full-text-search or arbitrary [[SQL]] queries results in one or more SRA accessions.

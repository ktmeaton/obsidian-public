# Bayes Factor

[[Bayes Factor]] is a method to evaluate competing models in a [[Bayesian]] framework. In essence, it is the ratio of the [[Marginal Likelihood]] of the models. 

## Formula

 (log) Bayes factor = log(P(YjMhet))log(P(YjMiso))

## Interpretation

[[Kass 1995 Bayes Factors]] provides guidelines for interpretations:

| Value | Interpretation        |
| ----- | --------------------- |
| >=5   | "Very Strong Support" |
| 3     | "Strong Support"      | 
| 1     | "Positive Evidence"   |

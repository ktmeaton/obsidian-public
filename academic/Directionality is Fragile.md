# Directionality is Fragile

Appropriate use of phylogeography requires three conditions:
- The geographic distribution is densely sampled ([[Sampling Bias]]). 
- The organism measurable evolves across the geographic distribution .

Inferring directed movement (ie. migration) with [[Phylogeography|phylogeography]] is an extremely fragile process. That is to say, the results and thus interpretations are sensitive to a number of factors. Perhaps the most obvious and intuitive is [[Sampling Bias]]. When the full distribution of a disease is not known, or sparsely sampled, geographic reconstructions reflect the [[Sampling Bias|sampling strategy]], rather than disease processes

1. Sampling Bias
1. Geocoding

How do you know if the distribution is densely sampled enough? When new data, or randomly injected data, from outside the sampling strategy does not disrupt the original findings and interpretations. For example, the study of [[West Nile Virus]] in the USA by [[Kalkauskas et al. 2021 Sampling Bias Model|Kalkauskas et al. 2021]].

[[Nuance is Powerful]]. I wonder if the trees constructed by clade might have higher resolution (more branch-defining SNPs), increasing branch supports and mugration confidence.

But the more you sample, the more internal branches you create... and branch support drops.

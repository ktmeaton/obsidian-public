## Summary

> *"Interestingly, a recent analysis of Bronze Age strains of Y. pestis is consistent with a much higher substitution rate in this bacterium, at ~10−7 substitutions per site year (Rasmussen et al., 2015), in contrast to the data presented here and previously (Cui et al., 2013; Morelli et al., 2010). Why these data sets differ so fundamentally in estimated substitution rate is clearly an important area for future study."*

# Nature Microbiology

## Submissions

### Initial Submission

#### Cover letter

Authors should provide a cover letter that includes the affiliation and contact information for the corresponding author. Authors should briefly discuss the importance of the work and explain why it is considered appropriate for the diverse readership of _Nature Microbiology_. Any prior discussions with a _Nature Microbiology_ editor about the work described in the manuscript should also be mentioned.

#### Initial format requirements

The Nature journals are flexible with regard to the format of initial submissions. Within reason, style and length will not influence consideration of a manuscript. But to facilitate the review process we strongly encourage you to incorporate the manuscript text and figures into a single pdf with all lines numbered or Microsoft Word file. Suitably high resolution figures may be inserted within the text at appropriate positions or grouped at the end. Each figure legend should be presented on the same page as its figure. The reference list should include article titles.

Although not required at the initial submission stage, authors are encouraged to review the article format requirements for [final submission](http://www.nature.com/nmicrobiol/info/final-submission) so they can familiarize themselves with what will be required if the editor invites submission of a revised version of the manuscript.

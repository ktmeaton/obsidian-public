- CADHAM Public Laboratory 

## Description

**Genomics Liaison Technical Officer (GLTO)**

- The new Canadian Public Health Laboratory Network (CPHLN) COVID Genomics Program (CCGP) was created to address immediate public health needs within Canadaâ€™s COVID-19 response.
- CCGP builds capacity directly within provincial public health laboratories and partners in support of National COVID surveillance and outbreak response.
- Priorities include strengthening genomic-based surveillance of SARS-CoV-2, including interprovincial, national and international data sharing, increasing sequencing throughput, and reducing overall sequencing and data analysis turnaround time.
- The emergence of COVID variants of concern (VOC) has rapidly increased the urgency and importance of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing. There is a pressing need to deploy resources to build capacity to meet the need for rapid identification of VOCs, arising domestically or linked to international arrivals.
- Continued genome-based identification is essential for ongoing surveillance and outbreak investigations, monitoring for variants with increased transmissibility and disease severity, including mutations that reduce testing and vaccine efficacy.

# Duchene et al. (2021) The Impact of Public Health Interventions in the Nordic Countries during the First Year of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission and Evolution

## Summary

> Automatically created by [`seldon`](https://github.com/ktmeaton/seldon).

- [[Sweden]] exhibited a greater number of cases than the other [[Nordic]] countries and our results are consistent with periodically higher community transmission in [[Sweden]] compared with the other [[Nordic]] Countries during the first 12 months of the [[COVID-19 Pandemic]], higher community transmission does not necessarily imply a causal  relationship with excess deaths.
- Our phylogenetic analyses revealed that [[SARS-CoV-2]] was  imported to all [[Nordic]] countries between January and late February 2020, with detectable [[Community Transmission|community transmission]] from early February in [[Sweden]] and from early  March in the other [[Nordic]] countries as inferred by the  presence of transmission chains (Figure 1).
- We fit linear regressions for [[Transmission Network|transmission chain]] size against the detection date (the date of collection of the  first genome within a transmission chain), such that positive trends would suggest increased community  spread over time (i.e. larger transmission chains over  time).
- We defined [[Transmission Network|transmission chains]] as [[Monophyletic|monophyletic]] groups of genomes (at least two) collected from one of  the [[Nordic]] countries, which is analogous to transmission lineages as defined previously.
- Sustained [[Community Transmission|community transmission]] continued for all [[Nordic]] countries beyond April 2020, with the exception of [[Iceland]], which was characterised by a relatively short 1-month  period of [[Community Transmission|community transmission]], and [[Norway]], which  had a low number of cases combined with a low  sequencing intensity of 0.04 (Table).

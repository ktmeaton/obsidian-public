# 2021 Eaton Committee Update

Hi Everyone,

I hope everyone is doing well and getting to enjoy some vacation time! I'm writing this email to provide you with a program update in lieu of Spring/Summer committee meeting. My last committee meeting was Dec 15, 2020 where 3 goals were identified:

1. *"Specify the questions she wants to address in each of her final two papers - via active and immediate discussions with her collaborators, including Nukhet Varlik, Ann Carmichael, Dan Salkeld, Eddie Holmes and Sebastian Duchene. Then finish analyses and generate answers or suggested answers to those questions."*
2. *"Together with collaborators craft a strong interdisciplinary paper that touches on the themes in her research proposal. Submit paper 2 (Global Plague Phylogeny paper) for peer review."*
3. *"Finish paper 3 (Danish Plague Paper), which, fortunately is an offshoot of paper 2, and again data is in hand and already analyzed. This paper will appear as a draft in the thesis, ready for submission post defence."*

**Dissertation Papers:**
- Paper 1 | Published | *NCBImeta: efficient and comprehensive metadata retrieval from NCBI databases.*
- Paper 2 | Editing | *Plagued by a cryptic clock: New insight from the global phylogeny of Yersinia pestis.*
- Paper 3 | Editing | *A 900-year longitudinal study of Yersinia pestis in Denmark captures the rise and fall of a plague pandemic.*

I applied for (and was granted) a one-term extension to my PhD, to complete by December 30, 2021 at the latest. 
**For the next 3 months, I would like to propose the following goals:**
1. August 30 | Co-author approved manuscript of Paper 2. Submit for peer-reviewed publishing.
2. September 30 |  Co-author approved draft of Paper 3 for dissertation.
3. October 1 | Submit full dissertation to committee for approval. After approval, initiate defense process.


Cheers,
Katherine

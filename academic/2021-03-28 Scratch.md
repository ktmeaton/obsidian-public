## [[Plague Phylodynamics and Phylogeography]]
I woke up with a few questions today.

- Which [[Clade|clades]] are represented in the [[Xu 2019 Historical Genomic Data|Xu et al. (2019)]] database?
- How exactly is [[Sequence-Free]] analysis done?
- Is it a problem that the [[Sequence-Free]] samples drastically outnumber the samples with sequences?
- To illustrate [[Genome|genomic]] [[Sampling Bias]], I could create comparative [[Map|maps]] of [[Genome|genomic]] vs. [[Document|document]] evidence.
- Would I want to remove all samples before 1776 (ie. the ancient samples)? Would I want to remove all samples not within the designated clades (ie. 0.PE)

## [[Job|Jobs]]

## Summary

> "In general, 2.MED1 strains isolated in the VolgaUral sandy focus in the early 20th century (1912–1945) are characterised by the presence of separate parallel evolutionary lines having long branches, which indicates their rapid evolution, possibly associated with the occupation of new territories and/or changes in climatic conditions."

# Eaton (2020) NCBImeta: Efficient and Comprehensive Metadata Retrieval from NCBI Databases

## Summary

> Automatically created by [`seldon`](https://github.com/ktmeaton/seldon).

- In response, NCBImeta aims to provide a more user-inclusive experience to metadata retrieval, that emphasizes real-time access and provides generalized frameworks for a wide variety of NCBIâ€™s databases.
- Accessory scripts are provided to supply external annotation files, to join tables within the local database so as to re-create the relational database structure, and finally to export the database as tabular text for downstream analyses.
- The output of NCBImeta, optionally a SQLite database or text file(s), can then be used by computational biologists for applications such as record filtering, project discovery, sample interpretation, and meta-analyses of published work.
- Journal of Open Source Software, 5(46), 1990.
- Use Case The following section demonstrates how NCBImeta can be used to obtain current and comprehensive metadata for a pathogenic bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, from various sequencing projects across the globe.

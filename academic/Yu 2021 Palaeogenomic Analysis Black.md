# Yu 2021 Palaeogenomic Analysis Of Black Rat (Rattus Rattus) Reveals Multiple European Introductions Associated With Human Economic History

## Seldon Summary

> - European Roman rats (Roman_WEU);; (middle, blue) Roman rats (Roman) and western European  482  medieval rats (Med_WEU); and (bottom, green) post-medieval Buda Castle rats (BUD001/4) and the  483  medieval Buda Castle rat (BUD003), respectively.
> - Here, in order to reconstruct the population history of European black rats, we generated a de  100  novo genome assembly of the black rat, 67 ancient black rat mitogenomes and 36 ancient nuclear  101  genomes from sites spanning the 1st-17th centuries CE in Europe and North Africa.
> - The split time between brown rat and black rat/Asian house rat  247  lineages was estimated to be 1.94 Mya (within the 95% Highest Posterior Density (HPD) range  248  estimated using mitochondrial genomes in a previous study 11), while the split of Asian house rat and  249  .

> - This study explores the historic dispersal of commensal black rats using a de novo genome assembly  516  for the black rat, ancient and modern mtDNA from across Europe, Africa, and the Indian Ocean, and  517  ancient nuclear genomes from the Mediterranean and Europe.
> - To explore the black ratâ€™s European population history in greater detail, we shotgun sequenced 36  348  ancient and 3 modern black rats from 17 sites to 0.2x-16x coverage for whole genome analysis,  349  including 18 females and 21 males determined by the coverage on sex chromosomes (Supplementary  350  Table 11).
> - Considered alongside the paucity of archaeological rat remains from the 6th-8th centuries CE  526  (particularly in northern and western Europe), this population turnover suggests that the black rat  527  population and range declined during the early medieval period.

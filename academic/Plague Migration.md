# Plague Migration


1. It is very challenging to reconstruct the geographic spread of plague. Because, like the molecular clock rate variation, there is substantial variation in spread.

1. Several populations appear to migrate via slow, smooth continuous spread. These populations have strong IBD profiles (significant correlation between )

- Reconstructing the spread of plague is very difficult, because there is so much variation.
- How does plague move across the landscape? The disease is most famous for it's pandemic-scale outbreaks.
- But what happens in the "quiet"/endemic periods?

- Highly localized/restricted (ex. Pestoides 0.PE2, which subspecies is that?)

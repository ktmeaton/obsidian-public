## Submission

Authors should provide a cover letter that includes the affiliation and contact information for the corresponding author. Authors should briefly discuss the importance of the work and explain why it is considered appropriate for the diverse readership of _Nature Ecology & Evolution_. Any prior discussions with a _Nature Ecology & Evolution_ editor about the work described in the manuscript should also be mentioned.

The Nature journals are flexible with regard to the format of initial submissions. Within reason, style and length will not influence consideration of a manuscript. But to facilitate the review process we strongly encourage you to incorporate the manuscript text and figures into a single pdf with all lines numbered or Microsoft Word file. Suitably high-resolution figures may be inserted within the text at appropriate positions or grouped at the end. Each figure legend should be presented on the same page as its figure. We encourage, where possible,¬†the transparent representation of individual data points and therefore discourage the use of bar charts where other formats could be used. The reference list should include article titles.

### Format

All textual content should be provided in a single file, prepared using either Word or TeX/LaTeX; figures should be provided in individual files (see below).

The manuscript text file should include the following parts, in order: a title page with author affiliations and contact information (the corresponding author should be identified with an asterisk); the specific sections required for each content type; then References, Acknowledgements (optional), Author Contributions, Competing Interests statement, Figure Legends and Tables.

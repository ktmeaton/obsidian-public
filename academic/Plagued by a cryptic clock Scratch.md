# Plagued by a cryptic clock Scratch

#### Slow, Long-Term Substitution Rate

_[[Yersinia pestis\|Y. pestis]]_ is particularly susceptible to the time-dependency of molecular rates, as it has one of the slowest substitution rates observed among bacterial pathogens [[Duchene 2016 Genome-scale Rates Evolutionary|[@duchene2016GenomescaleRatesEvolutionary]]]. The substitution rate of _[[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]]_ has previously been estimated to range from 1 x 10<sup>-8</sup> to 2 x 10<sup>-8</sup> substitutions/site/year [[Cui 2013 Historical Variations Mutation\|[@cui2013HistoricalVariationsMutation;]] [[Spyrou 2019 Phylogeography Second Plague|@spyrou2019PhylogeographySecondPlague]]], or 1 substitution every 10 to 25 years. In application, this means that  _[[Y. pestis]]_ lineages often cannot be differentiated until multiple decades have passed, a concept generally referred to as the phylodynamic threshold [@duchene2020TemporalSignalPhylodynamic].

A historical example of this can be seen during the Second Pandemic, where isolates dated to the medieval [[Black Death]] (1348-1353) are nearly indistinguishable clones (Figure @fig:rtt). A modern example is the *medievalis* population, where the youngest samples (2010s) have diverged little compared to those from a century prior (1910s). This highlights a significant limitation and cautionary note for _[[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]]_ phylogenetics, as comparisons over short time scales (10 to 100 years) may have limited resolving power.  Furthermore, the little phylogenetic signal that accumulates in the population may be easily obscured or biased by spurious mutations in a single sample. 

#### High, Short Term Mutation Rate

The *medievalis* population is an extreme example of mutational bias, as several samples collected between 1970 and 1980 are exceptionally divergent (Figure @fig:rtt). This short-term diversity is largely due to mutations observed in only a single isolate, which manifest as long terminal branches in the maximum-likelihood phylogeny (Figure @fig:divtree_map_timeline, Figure @fig:long_branches). The presence of transient mutations, or long branches, is not isolated to the *medievalis* population and also strongly impacts the *pestoides* ([[0.PE]]), *intermedium* ([[1.IN]]), and *orientalis* ([[1.ORI]]) populations (Figure @fig:meanRate_stdev_tmrca). Given the extensive presence of these apparent outliers, inclusion or exclusion of these samples may have profound impacts on spatiotemporal analyses. Specifically, these populations may appear to have more rate acceleration events, a faster rate of spread, and unexpectedly young node dates.

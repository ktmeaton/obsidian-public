Hi Everyone,

Miriam and I are moving to Alberta very soon! On October 26th to be precise. We've been planning a move for a while, but recent issues in our apartment have forced us to vacate ASAP.

We would like to see you all before we leave and are hoping to find a safe, outdoor option. We are hoping to have a small, going-away party on **Saturday, October 23**. Possibly on the Phoenix's patio, or in someone's backyard if anyone is willing to host? We have quite the alcohol collection that needs to be drunk (or given away), since it can't be packed :'(

We realize this is very last minute, and if you are too busy we completely understand! We just want to let you all know how much your friendships have meant to us over that years and we would love to see you all before we head back west ❤ .

Cheers,
Katherine and Miriam (AKA MirKat)

# Create New Directories for Snippy and IQTREE

I want to have better organization of the output folders once filtering occurs. This will let me try different parameters without overwriting.

```yaml:
results:
  - snippy_multi:
    - chromosome:
	  - filter1
	  - filter5
```

- [x] ```snippy_extract```
- [x] ```snippy_filter```
- [x] ```plot_missing_data```
- [x] ```plot_snp_matrix```
- [x] ```iqtree``` 
- [x] ```iqtree_scf``` 
- [x] ```parse_tree``` 
- [x] ``clock_model``` 
- [x] ```clock_plot```

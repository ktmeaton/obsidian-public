Abstract: Repeated emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with increased transmissibility
necessitates rapid detection and characterization of new lineages. To address this need, we
developed PyR0, a hierarchical Bayesian multinomial logistic regression model that infers
relative transmissibility of all viral lineages across geographic regions, detects lineages
increasing in prevalence, and identifies mutations relevant to transmissibility. Applying PyR0 to
all publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we identify numerous substitutions that increase
transmissibility, including previously identified spike mutations and many non-spike mutations
within the  nucleocapsid and nonstructural proteins. PyR0forecasts growth of new lineages from
their mutational profile, identifies viral lineages of concern as they emerge, and prioritizes
mutations of biological and public health concern for functional characterization.
One Sentence summary: A Bayesian hierarchical model of all viral genomes predicts lineage
transmissibility and identifies associated mutations.
Main Text:
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has featured repeated waves of cases driven by the emergence of
new lineages with higher transmissibility. Rapidly identifying such lineages as they emerge and
accurately forecasting their dynamics is critical for guiding outbreak response, but doing so
effectively requires interrogating the entirety of the global SARS-CoV-2 genomic dataset. The
large size (currently over 2.5 million virus genomes) and geographic and temporal variability of
the available data present significant challenges that will only become more acute as more
viruses are sequenced. Current phylogenetic approaches are computationally inefficient on
datasets with more than ~5000 samples and take days to run at that scale. Ad hoc methods to

estimate the relative transmissibility of particular SARS-CoV-2 lineages are a computationally
efficient alternative (1–3), but have typically relied on models in which one or two lineages of
interest are compared to all others and cannot capture the complex dynamics of multiple
co-circulating lineages.
Furthermore, estimates of transmissibility based on lineage frequency data alone (2–4) do not
take advantage of additional statistical power that can be gained from analyzing the independent
appearance and growth of the same mutation in multiple lineages. Performing a mutation-based
analysis of lineage prevalence has the additional advantage of identifying specific genetic
determinants of a lineage’s phenotype, which is critically important both for predicting the
phenotype of new lineages and for understanding the biology of transmission and pathogenesis.
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has already been dominated by several genetic changes of
functional and epidemiological importance, including the spike (S) D614G mutation that has
made SARS-CoV-2 more transmissible(5, 6) and is associated with higher viral loads(5). In
addition, mutations found in Variant of Concern (VoC) lineages, such as S:N439R, S:N501Y, and
S:E484K, have been linked, respectively, to increased transmissibility(7), enhanced binding to
ACE2(8) and antibody escape (9, 10). Identifying functionally important mutations is
challenging, however, against the large background of genetic variants with little or no
phenotypic consequence.
We set out to formulate a principled approach to modeling the apparent transmissibility of
SARS-CoV-2 lineages, estimating their growth rate as a proxy for transmissibility and explicitly
modeling it as a linear combination of the effects of individual mutations. We developed PyR0, a
hierarchical Bayesian regression model that enables scalable analysis of the complete set of
publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes, and that could be applied to any viral genomic dataset
and to other phenotypes. The model, which is summarized in Figure 1 and described in detail in
the supplemental note, avoids the complexity of full phylogenetic inference by first clustering
genomes by their PANGO lineages (11), and then estimating the incremental effect on growth
rate of each of the most common amino acid changes on the lineages in which they appear. By
regressing growth rate as a function of genome sequence, the model shares statistical strength
among genetically similar lineages without explicitly relying on phylogeny. By modeling only
the multinomial proportion of different lineages rather than the absolute number of samples for
each lineage (4, 12), and by doing so within 14-day intervals in 1,070 globally distributed
geographic regions, the model achieves robustness to a number of sources of bias across regions
and over time that affect all lineages, including differences in sampling rate and differences and
changes in transmission due to e.g. social behaviours, policy changes, and vaccination.
We fit PyR0 to 2,160,748 SARS-CoV-2 genomes available on GISAID (13, 14) as of July 6,
2021, in a model that contained 1,281 PANGO lineages and 2,337 nonsynonymous mutations.
The output of the model is a posterior distribution for the relative growth rate of each lineage and
for the contribution to the growth rate from each mutation. This posterior distribution was
inferred using variational inference implemented in the Pyro (15) probabilistic programming
framework (see Supplemental Materials). The trained model can be used to infer lineage growth
rates, predict the growth rate of completely new lineages, forecast future lineage proportions, and
estimate the effects of individual mutations on transmissibility.

The model's inferred lineage growth rates (Figure 2) show a modest upward trend among all
lineages, accompanied by numerous lineages with dramatically higher rates, with the latter
becoming more frequent beginning late in 2020. Sensitivity analyses revealed broad consistency
of growth rate estimates across spatial data subsets (Figure S1). The upward trend may in part
reflect an upward bias caused by the lineage assignment process, as can be seen in simulation
studies (Figure S2), but the high tail of the distribution exhibits elevated growth rates far in
excess of this trend. The model correctly inferred B.1.617.2 to have the highest growth rate to
date, 2.6-fold (95% CI, 2.27-2.97) higher than the original A lineage (Figure 2 inset); similar
growth rates were estimated for its sub-lineages AY.1 and AY.2 (Table 1). These growth rates,
obtained in early July 2021, correctly predicted that B.1.617.2 and sublineages (collectively
called Delta in the WHO classification) would continue to displace other lineages, including the
previously dominant B.1.1.7 and even other highly transmissible lineages such as B.1.621 and
C.36.3 (Figure S3).
By basing growth rate estimates on the contributions of individual mutations, PyR0 can forecast
the growth rates of unobserved lineages using their mutational profiles alone. This is possible
with SARS-CoV-2 because of the high rate of convergent evolution (Table 1, Figure S4), which
allows the model to infer the growth rate of new constellations of mutations based on the
trajectories of other lineages in which they have previously emerged. This predictive capability is
highly desirable from a public health standpoint because forecasts are available as soon as new
lineages appear. To test the reliability of this kind of estimate, we trained leave-one-out
estimators on subsets of the dataset with entire subclades removed (Figure S5). These estimators
showed excellent agreement with estimators based on the observed behavior of the lineages, and
they were also much more accurate than naive phylogenetic estimators that assume the growth
rate of each new strain is equal to its parent lineage's growth rate (Pearson's ρ = 0.91, after
correcting for parent growth rate, Figure S5). These results demonstrate the feasibility of this
kind of estimate and provide a realistic test of the accuracy of our mutation-level estimates.
We also found that the model would have provided early warning of the rise of VoCs, had it been
routinely applied to available SARS-CoV-2 data. For example, PyR0would have forecast the
coming dominance of B.1.1.7 in early November 2020 (Figure S6A), while the first models
forecasting its rapid rise were published in January 2021 (16); a similar prediction would have
been available for B.1.617.2 by late April 2021 (Figure S6B). While variant-specific models
were accurate and useful (2) in predicting the rise of these lineages, each modeling effort was
specific to a particular lineage and geographic region; by contrast, PyR0’s global approach
provides similar early detection while also offering automated, rapid, and unbiased consideration
of all variants and lineages, together with ranking based on relative transmissibility. We tested
the model's predictive ability (Figure S6,S7) and found that forecasts were reliable for 1-2
months into the future (Table S1, Figure S8). Forecasts were based on the current state of the
pandemic and predicted near-term dynamics, ignoring the unpredictable appearance of new
lineages. Rapid assessment of emerging lineages relies on timely application of PANGO or
alternative lineage classification schemes.
Unbiased, genome-wide estimates of the effect of SARS-CoV-2 mutations on growth rate also
provide a powerful tool for better understanding the biology of transmissibility. Our model
allowed us to estimate the contribution of 2,337 amino acid substitutions and deletions (Table 1)

to lineage growth and to rank them by inferred statistical significance (Figure S1 and S9).
Cross-validation confirmed that these results replicate across different geographic regions
(Figure S10).
The highest concentrations of growth rate-associated mutations were found in the S, N, and the
ORF1 polyprotein genes (ORF1a and ORF1b, Figures 3, S11-12). S also demonstrated spatial
autocorrelation (p=0.003), a characteristic that also held for the genome as a whole (Table S2),
consistent with the existence of functional hotspots. Within S, there were three hotspots of
growth rate-enhancing mutations, each within a defined functional region: the N-terminal
domain, the receptor-binding domain, and the furin-cleavage site (Figure S12A). These regions
include several high-scoring mutations, including S:D614G (6, 17), S:L452R (7), and
S:ΔH69V70 (18), that have been shown to increase transmissibility in experimental systems,
while S:P681R increases S proteolytic processing (19) and fusion (20). Another cluster was
observed at positions 160–210 of N (Figure S12B). Although previously uncharacterized,
mutations in this region were recently linked to increased efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 RNA
packaging (21). Within ORF1, we found growth rate-associated mutations across all viral
enzymes, and clusters within additional non-structural proteins (nsps). The highest concentration
of mutations with predictive power is found in nsp2, 4, 6, and nsp12–14 (Figure S11B,S12C-D),
suggesting unexplored function at those sites. For example, nsp4 and nsp6 have roles in
assembly of replication compartments, and substitutions in these regions may influence the
kinetics of replication (see supplement). We note that while convergent evolution makes it
possible to identify candidate functional mutations, observational data alone is insufficient to
declare mutations as causal. For this reason hits identified by our study require functional
followup, facilitated by our uncertainty-ranked list of important mutations.
In summary, PyR0 provides an unbiased, automated approach for detecting viral lineages with
increased growth rate. Because it assesses the contribution of individual mutations and
aggregates across all lineages and geographic regions, it can identify mutations and gene regions
that likely drive transmissibility, and it can predict the relative growth rate of new lineages based
solely on viral sequence. Applied to the full set of publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes, it
provides a principled, unbiased analysis of the mutations driving increased transmissibility of the
virus, identifying experimentally established driver mutations in S and    highlighting the key
role of non-S mutations, particularly in N, ORF1b, and ORF1a, in promoting increased growth
rate. The latter findings underscore the extensive unexplored viral biology of this recently
emerged virus. The highlighted genetic diversity offers promising targets for follow-up
investigation and may open new avenues for therapeutic or public health intervention.

Regression model of relative transmissibility (PyR0 model)
We fit a Bayesian, hierarchical multinomial logistic regression model to data from GISAID using
Pyro. Details are provided in the supplemental note below.
Simulation of lineages
We carried out a simulation study to determine whether the process of clustering genomes into
named lineages could generate an artifactual increase in estimated growth rate. The simulation
was of a single neutrally evolving viral population with discrete generations and a stochastic
population size generated by a highly overdispersed negative binomial distribution with the
current growth rate. (Overdispersion parameter = 0.11, which yields 10% of cases causing 80%
of transmission.) The growth rate is 2.5 for the first 10 generations; subsequently it drops to 1.5
until the viral population reaches 80,000 infections, whereupon it drops again to 0.8. When the
population decreases to 10,000, the growth switches back to 1.5, and continues cycling when the
high and low population thresholds are reached. (A model with a roughly constant-sized
population yields similar results.) The population starts as a single named lineage. Each
generation, the most successful nodes in that generation are determined by looking ahead four
generations and counting descendants. New lineages are assigned to the nodes with the most
descendants (minimum of 200 descendants), up to a maximum of 10 lineages per generation.
10% of all infections are randomly sampled and any lineage with fewer than 20 descendants is
discarded. When all new lineages have been generated and all nodes assigned a lineage, a global
multinomial logistic regression is performed, using the Python package sklearn.linear_model,
yielding estimates for the relative growth rates of all lineages.
Spatial analysis of mutation coefficients
To assess the spatial structure of the inferred amino acid coefficients βf (described in
Probabilistic Model below), we utilize the Moran I spatial autocorrelation statistic. We report
(see Table S1) one-sided p-values for Moran I computed using a permutation test with 999,999
random permutations. We use a gaussian weighting function of the form
exp(-distance2/lengthscale2), where distance is measured in units of nucleotides. We compute
Moran I statistics both for individual genes and the entire genome. For larger genes whose extent

is 1000+ nucleotides we use a length scale of 50 nucleotides. For smaller genes (e.g. ORF8) we
set the length scale to one twentieth of the extent of the gene. When considering the entire set of
amino acid changes, i.e. all 2,337 coefficients that make up βf, we compute the Moran I statistic
for two different length scales. We note, however, that the Moran I statistic is somewhat
simplistic, since it is designed to pick up spatial structure at a single length scale. In particular it
can be insensitive to complex spatial structure that involves multiple overlapping substructures at
different scales.
Analysis of substitution statistics
To assess enrichment of amino acid changes between different sets we performed multiple
testing corrected one-sided binomial tests of each event type (e.g. I to V). We examined the
following sets of mutations and performed comparisons between them: (a) all mutational events
available in the input nextclade dataset (b) mutational events that were sufficiently prevalent in
nextclade so as to be considered by the model (c) Top 255 amino acid substitutions as scored by
Δ log R. (d) Top 55 amino acid substitutions in spike as considered by Δ log R. In comparison
with the input set, we did not observe enrichment of the most significant hits for the entire viral
genome and spike protein for any mutational event, suggesting the model does not introduce
undue biases (Figure S13).

Data Preparation
We downloaded 2,231,068 samples from GISAID (13, 14) on July 6, 2021.  Each sample record
includes labels for time, location, PANGO lineage annotation (11), and genetic sequence.  We
discard records with missing time, location, or lineage; 2,161,248 records remain.  We call
mutations using the NextClade tool (23), discarding sequences whose alignment quality is not
reported as “good” (sequences discarded in this step are excluded from the mutation features Xsf ,
but are still included in the counts ytps), and discarding the seven lineages with fewer than 5 good
alignments; 1281 lineages remain.  Because PANGO lineages are genetically heterogeneous
(with small variation within each lineage), we create continuous [0,1]-valued features Xsf
denoting, for each lineage (“strain”) s and mutation (“feature”) f, the proportion of samples in
that lineage exhibiting the mutation. We discard mutations that do not occur in the majority of
samples in any single lineage (i.e. features f with Xsf < ½ for all s); 2337 amino acid mutations
pass this threshold.  We bin time intervals into 14-day segments, choosing a multiple of 7 to
minimize weekly seasonality, but binning coarser than a week so as to reduce memory
requirements; this results in 42 time bins.
Because sample counts vary widely across GISAID geographic region (by as much as five orders
of magnitude), we aggregate regions into the following coarse partitions: each country counts as
a region, and any first level subregion of a country counts as a region if it has at least 50 samples;
otherwise it is aggregated into a whole-country bin. Note this means that e.g. a country may be
split up into its larger regions, with smaller regions being subsumed into an aggregate country
level bin. We then drop regions without samples in at least two different time intervals, resulting
in 1070 regions in total.

After preprocessing, the model input data are a T × P × S = 42 × 1070 × 1281 shaped array ytps
∈ ℕ of counts (this array is sparse but it is not sparse along any of its 2-dimensional marginals),
and an S × F = 1281 × 2337 shaped array Xsf ∈ [0, 1] of mutation features.
Cases per day (see Figure 2 inset) were estimated by multiplying confirmed case count data from
Johns Hopkins University by the estimated proportion of each lineage within each (time, region)
bin.
Probabilistic Model
We model relative lineage growth with a hierarchical Bayesian regression model with a
multinomial likelihood. Arrays in the model index over one or more indices: T=42 time steps
(increments of 14 days) t; S=1281 PANGO lineages (“strains”) s; P=1070 regions (“places”) p;
and F=2337 amino acid changes (“features”) f.  The model, shown below, regresses lineage
counts ytps∈ ℕ in each time-region-lineage bin against amino acid mutation covariates
Xsf∈[0,1]. The variables y and X are observed and all other variables in the model are latent.
Each latent variable is governed by a prior distribution. The full model is specified as follows,
where the observed counts ytps are underlined:
The proportion of lineages in a single time-region bin is modeled as a Multinomial distribution
whose probability parameter is a multivariate logistic growth function softmax(αp· + tβp·/τ) with
intercept αps and slope βps in units of generation time τ = 5.5 days, where the softmax function
inputs and outputs vectors and is defined as
and where the dot subscripts αp·∈ ℝS and βp·∈ ℝS denote vectors over lineages. Early iterations
of the model used overdispersed likelihoods such as Dirichlet-Multinomial to account for
additional variability not directly encoded in the generative process. However, we found that we
can obtain much more accurate model predictions by using a Multinomial likelihood and
accounting for model misfit by adding hierarchical structure elsewhere. The intercepts αps denote
initial relative log prevalence of lineage s in region p; these are modeled hierarchically around
the global relative log prevalence αs of each lineage. The slopes βps are modeled hierarchically

mutation on a lineage’s growth rate, all other variation being equal. In figures we plot
as an estimate of effect size and plot the z-score

as a proxy for statistical significance.
Note that by regressing against amino acid changes we obviate the need to directly incorporate
phylogenetic information into the model: if two lineages are close together in a phylogeny, then
their amino acid features are likely also similar, so their regressed growth rates will likely be
similar. By sharing statistical strength in this way we are also able to make accurate predictions
for emergent lineages with few observations.  Both of the hierarchies in α and β empirically
improve model fit in the presence of heavily skewed observations (e.g. most samples are from
the UK, and there is a long tail of sparsely sampled regions).
We place weak priors on scale parameters σ1, σ2, and σ4 (these denote standard deviations, the
square roots of prior variance). The σ1 and σ2 priors are centered at large values to allow for wide
variation in initial infection proportions across regions. The σ4 prior is centered around the
smaller value e−4 ≈ 0.018 because we expect little variation of relative growth rate across
geographic regions a priori (some variation is expected, due to geographic variations in e.g. age
distribution, behavior, or genetics as in binding affinity due HLA complex genotypes (24)). We
fix the linear regression scale parameter σ3 to a small value, forcing the regression problem
towards a sparse solution (i.e. we assume a priori that most observed mutations have little effect
on growth rate). We choose a Logistic prior on regression coefficients because it is heavier-tailed
than a Normal prior, but not so heavy-tailed that the regression problem becomes multimodal (as
it would for e.g. a Cauchy or Student’s t prior). Like the Laplace distribution, the Logistic
distribution is a location-scale family whose exponential tails are maximally heavy while
ensuring the conditional log density is concave, leading to a conditionally unimodal posterior and
robust inference (see Figure S14). Unlike the Laplace distribution, the Logistic distribution is
smooth, with density given by
This proportional growth model differs from many forecasting models in the literature that are
formulated in terms of absolute sample counts. We choose to model relative proportions rather
than absolute counts because the relative model is robust to a number of sources of bias,
including: sampling bias across regions (e.g. one region samples 1000x more than another);
sampling bias over time (e.g. change in sampling rate over time); and change in absolute growth
rate of all lineages, in any (time, region) bin (e.g. due to changes in local policies or weather, as
long as those changes affect all lineages equally). However the model is susceptible to the
following sources of bias: biased sampling in any (time, region) cell (e.g. sequencing only in
case of S-gene target failure); and changes in sampling bias within a single region over time (e.g.
a country has a lab in only one city, then spins up a second lab in another distant city with
different lineage proportions).

This model has several advantages over existing approaches. First, it provides a principled,
agnostic approach that can be applied to a large dataset to identify lineages that demonstrate
concerning epidemiological features. Second, by modeling the relative growth rate of lineages
separately across 1070 geographic regions, the model is robust to region-specific differences in
non-pharmaceutical interventions and vaccination rates. Third, the hierarchical nature of the
model which represents lineages as collections of mutations accurately reflects the underlying
biology and yields both strain- and lineage-specific coefficients from a single inferential
approach.
Probabilistic Inference
The model is implemented in the Pyro probabilistic programming language (15) built on
PyTorch (25). To fit an approximate joint posterior distribution over all latent variables (a space
of dimension 2,744,961), we train a flexible reparameterized variational distribution using
stochastic variational inference. Our variational approach starts by reparameterizing the model
via a sequence of learnable but distribution-preserving transforms: decentering transforms (26)
on the α and β latent variables, and a learnable per-region per-lineage time shift in each linear
function αps+ tβps/τ.  Reparameterizing is particularly helpful in avoiding Neal’s-funnel situations
(27) by smoothing out the geometry of latent variables with Normal prior whose scale parameter
is also a latent variable. After reparameterizing we model the posterior on the reparameterized
linear coefficients βf as a low-rank multivariate Normal distribution (rank 200 covariance +
diagonal noise), and model all remaining latent variables as mean field transformed Normal
distributions. The low-rank multivariate Normal distribution on βf allows the approximate
posterior to capture correlated uncertainty among competing mutations each of which might
explain increased growth rate. The combined variational distribution has 7,334,172 parameters.
Variational inference is performed for 10,000 iterations with the Adam optimizer with clipped
gradients and an exponentially decreasing learning rate schedule and initial learning rates
between 0.05 and 0.0025 for different parameter groups (see Figure S15). Optimization proceeds
in batch-mode, i.e. without any data subsampling. We initialize model parameters to median
prior values with a small amount of noise added to avoid scale parameters collapsing early in
training. After inference we make predictions by drawing 1000 posterior samples. See source
code for detailed optimizer and initialization configuration.
Inference and prediction on a single GPU (NVIDIA Tesla P100 with 16GB of RAM) takes under
15 minutes, which is about the same amount of time required to download and preprocess each
daily snapshot of data from GISAID. Inference cost is O((TP+F)S) but does not depend directly
on the number of genetic samples, since samples are aggregated into counts y of constant shape
T×P×S.
We emphasize that inference in this model is very challenging due to the large dimension of the
latent space (namely 2,744,961), itself a consequence of the large number of regions, lineages,
and mutations considered by the model. While variational inference has a number of attractive
features, especially computationally, like any approximate inference scheme it comes with
disadvantages. In our case the most notable disadvantage of variational inference is its propensity
to yield biased posterior uncertainty estimates. Typically posterior uncertainty is underestimated,

leading to credible intervals (CI) that in some cases can be unrealistically narrow. The primary
parameters of interest in the PyR0 model are the mutation-level coefficients βf and the per-lineage
growth rates
. Since the latter quantity governs the prior over βps, which in turn directly
Σ𝑓 β𝑓 𝑋𝑠𝑓
feeds into the multinomial likelihood, the per-lineage growth rates are more-or-less tightly
constrained by the observed counts ytps. Consequently the posterior uncertainty of per-lineage
growth rates is comparatively easy to estimate and we expect variational inference to yield
reasonable credible intervals for these quantities. In contrast the mutation-level coefficients βf
interact with correlated features Xsf (leading to a multi-modal posterior) and are less directly
constrained by the observed counts ytps. Consequently it is significantly more challenging to
estimate the corresponding posterior uncertainty. In practice we obtain implausibly narrow
credible intervals for these quantities and the posterior uncertainty must be interpreted with
caution. Importantly, while the uncertainty estimates for βf should not be taken at face value, we
believe that they are still very useful for interpreting inferred model parameters, since they can
be used to rank/prioritize different hits βf. In particular, while the absolute magnitudes of βf
uncertainty estimates are implausible, their relative magnitudes are plausible and thus useful for
ranking. Since we consider a large number of mutations (F=2337) this information is invaluable
for designing experiments for functional characterization.
Implementation
We implemented the PyR0 model using the probabilistic programming language Pyro (15). The
model leverages PyTorch and Pyro to scale efficiently to large data sets and can therefore be
applied continuously as datasets grow, completing model training and prediction with millions of
viral genomes in minutes on a single GPU. We chose the Pyro framework because it cleanly
separates model specification from inference customization, and scales to large models and
datasets by leveraging GPUs. This flexible modeling framework allowed us to experiment with
different hierarchical structures. The speed of inference—which took under 15 minutes on a
single GPU on the full dataset of >2 million genomes—allowed quick model iteration and
thorough validation on subsets of the data, including both geographic cross-validation and
temporal backtesting.
Prediction
In Figure 2, the 95% confidence intervals in parentheses were estimated by drawing 1000
samples from the variational posterior distribution. Confirmed cases per day were estimated at
the end of the training period (July 6 2021) by combining .
Validation
We considered the possibility of biased submission to the GISAID database and compared results
obtained from the full dataset with results obtained from disjoint subsets. For this purpose we
divided the data into samples from the most heavily sampled region (Europe, with 1.25M
samples) and those from the rest of the world (with 0.9M samples) (Figures S1,S10).  This split
is motivated by most samples originating from the UK: we widened the region around the UK
until the region and its complement both had roughly equivalent statistical strength and narrow
posterior estimates.  Restricting to either all CDC data or CDC’s randomly sampled NS3 dataset
appears to result in insufficient diversity and leads to unclear results (Pearson correlation 0.49,

0.28, resp.). We conducted two-fold cross-validation experiments for both lineages (Figure S1)
and mutations (Figure S10).
Our model assumes each single point mutation independently linearly contributes to change in
growth rate.  A natural generalization is to search for groups of mutations that affect growth rate.
To explore this we fit a similar model of both single and pair mutations, considering only pairs
that lie within the same gene. Fitting this model discovered no pairwise mutations stronger than
the top 100 single mutations. We suspect the GISAID data are underpowered to discover
higher-order interactions between mutations, as the hypothesis space grows combinatorially in
the number of interacting mutations.

Supplemental Note 2:
We include here an extended discussion of high-scoring mutations.
Relation to other viruses
The concentration of putative transmission-promoting substitutions in N at positions 160-210 is
remarkable, but is supported by a similar observation in Ebola virus(28), and recent data for
SARS-CoV-2 showing mutations in that region increase the efficiency of viral packaging(21),
validating some of the model’s most unexpected predictions and supporting its ability to identify
novel biology.
Potential functional roles of mutations within ORF1
Our model highlighted mutations within the ORF1 non-structural proteins (nsps) whose
functions are not fully understood (e.g. Table S3). We found two predominant clusters within
ORF1a: one in the C-terminal ~120 amino acids of nsp4 and the other within the N-terminal
~160 amino acids of nsp6 (Figure S12C). Nsp4 and nsp6 are both membrane-anchored proteins
with roles in assembly and concentration of the viral replication and transcription complex
(RTC) machinery within double-membrane vesicles (29). Amino acid substitutions in these
regions, combined with transmission-associated mutations identified within additional
RTC-associated nsps (e.g., nsp12-16, Figure S12D), may therefore affect the kinetics of
replication and gene expression, resulting in higher virus yields from infected cells. Nsp2, a
rapidly evolving accessory protein (30)(31)(32) whose proposed function in disrupting host cell
signaling (33) and viral mRNA translation initiation (34) remains obscure, harbored many
additional mutations associated with higher transmissibility (Figure S12C).
The ORF1a-ORF1b polyprotein is processed into 16 non-structural proteins by two viral
proteases: a papain-like protease (nsp3) and 3C-like protease (nsp5). Multiple
transmission-associated mutations were found within the protease coding regions (e.g., ORF1a:
I1525V, ORF1a:L3338F). Most of the amino acid substitutions identified by our model were
outside of the domains containing catalytic residues for nsp3 (C1674, H1835, D1849) or nsp5
(H3304, C3408) (35)(36). However, the potential effects of these mutations on protease
architecture and activity warrant further experimentation. A few of the top mutations from our
model (e.g., ORF1a:T3255I, ORF1b:Q2403L) are positioned adjacent to nsp cleavage sites,
potentially influencing local structures and kinetics of polyprotein processing by nsp3 and nsp5
(Figure S12C-D).
Multiple highly-ranked mutations are distributed across the replication and
transcription-associated nsps in ORF1b (Figure S12D). The P314L (P323L) mutation in nsp12 –
the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) – emerged early during the pandemic and
became established in circulating lineages alongside S D614G (6). A second variant at this site
(P314F) was also highly ranked in our list. Additional mutations in nsp12 can be found adjacent
to the canonical fingers (A390V) and within the palm (E735D) subdomains of the RdRP
conserved catalytic site. The functional effects of these mutations on polymerase processivity
and fidelity remain to be investigated. A structural model of the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase

complex has been resolved (37)(38), and contains a single subunit of nsp12, two subunits of the
nsp13 helicase, and additional RdRP cofactor proteins (nsp7, 8, and 9). The ORF1b P314 residue
is located at the interaction interface between nsp12 and a single subunit of nsp8. Moreover, one
of the top mutations from our dataset, ORF1b:S1003G, is harbored within the nsp13 N-terminal
zinc-binding domain that directly interacts with nsp8 (39). These findings implicate
transmission-associated mutations within the SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis machinery in altering
the stability of the replication complex, possibly via interactions with nsp8.
Nsp14 is a dual-functional enzyme with N-terminal 3’-to-5’ exonuclease (ExoN) and C-terminal
guanine-N7 methyltransferase (N7-MTase) activities (40)(41) and is a core component of the
coronavirus RNA proofreading complex. Nsp14 is uniquely responsible for excision of
mismatched bases from the nascent RNA and methylation of the viral mRNA cap structure. Two
mutational hotspots in nsp14 map to discrete regions in the ExoN (L1681F and T1730I) and
N7-MTase (F1901L and P1936H) domains. The functional consequences of these clusters of
transmission-associated mutations on mRNA synthesis and genome replication remain unknown.

means of scale parameters (thick colored lines), and gradient norms of various parameter tensors
(light colored lines) over time.  Note the time axis is on a log scale, so there is negligible change
in the last 5,000 of 10,000 steps.

Figure S16. Distribution of lineage growth rates. We report differences in estimated log growth
rates of 1279 child/parent lineages (early lineages A and B are excluded as children). Strikingly
the distribution is skewed to the right, with 15 (resp., 33) child lineages exhibiting growth rates
that are at least 50% (resp., 25%) higher than the corresponding parent lineages. The 10 child
lineages whose growth rate exceeds that of their parents by at least 60% are listed in the figure.
The bottom dashed line shows the performance of a naive estimator that assumes all lineages
have the same growth rate.

Table S1. Regional evaluation of forecasts. We evaluate the ability of PyR0 to accurately forecast
the dominant lineage 4- and 8-weeks into the future in six selected regions with a relatively large
number of GISAID samples. Percentage accuracies are obtained by averaging over many
training windows, with the earliest ending on April 19th 2020 (i.e. backtesting).

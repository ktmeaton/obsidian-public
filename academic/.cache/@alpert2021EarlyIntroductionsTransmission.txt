In brief
The SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 was
introduced to the US in early December
2020 and soon became established
within many communities. The primary
points of entry into the US are identiﬁed
as New York, California, and Florida, and
exponential growth in these states
resulted in spread to neighboring states.

SUMMARY
The emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7, ﬁrst detected in the United Kingdom, has
become a global public health concern because of its increased transmissibility. Over 2,500 COVID-19 cases
associated with this variant have been detected in the United States (US) since December 2020, but the
extent of establishment is relatively unknown. Using travel, genomic, and diagnostic data, we highlight
that the primary ports of entry for B.1.1.7 in the US were in New York, California, and Florida. Furthermore,
we found evidence for many independent B.1.1.7 establishments starting in early December 2020, followed
by interstate spread by the end of the month. Finally, we project that B.1.1.7 will be the dominant lineage in
many states by mid- to late March. Thus, genomic surveillance for B.1.1.7 and other variants urgently needs
to be enhanced to better inform the public health response.
INTRODUCTION
The rise of SARS-CoV-2 infections to unprecedented levels in
the ﬁnal months of 2020 has led to the evolution of several vari-
ants with concerning mutations or traits (Lauring and Hodcroft,
2021). One such variant, designated B.1.1.7 (also 501Y.V1),
was identiﬁed in the United Kingdom (UK) during the fall of
2020 and proceeded to predominate circulation in the region
by early 2021 (Davies et al., 2021). Subsequent analyses sug-
gested that B.1.1.7 quickly rose in frequency because it was
�43%–90% more transmissible than other circulating lineages
(Davies et al., 2021), resulting in a 0.4–0.7 increase in the effec-
tive reproductive rate in the UK (Volz et al., 2021). Further anal-
ysis of contact tracing data suggested that infections with the
B.1.1.7 variant resulted in a 30%–50% higher secondary attack
rate (PHE, 2020). The B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant is deﬁned by
17 amino acid changes, including 8 changes in the spike protein
(Rambaut et al., 2020). Of particular note is the N501Y mutation
ll

2595
in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein, which is pre-
dicted to increase binding to human angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors (Starr et al., 2020) and is also a
deﬁning feature of other variants of concern, such as B.1.351
and P.1 (Faria et al., 2021; Lauring and Hodcroft, 2021; Tegally
et al., 2020). In addition, B.1.1.7 variants have a deletion in the
spike gene (D69/70 HV) that may increase cell infectivity (Kemp
et al., 2021) and has provided a serendipitous tracking
method for B.1.1.7 by causing a ‘‘spike gene target failure’’
(SGTF) in the commonly used Thermo Fisher TaqPath COVID-
19 Combo Kit (Borges et al., 2021; Volz et al., 2021). As of March
6, 2021, B.1.1.7 has been detected in 94 countries (https://
cov-lineages.org/global_report.html), which raises concerns
that B.1.1.7 will follow the trajectory that it took in the UK and
in other places around the world.
Current virus genomic surveillance across the United States
(US) is uneven, creating uncertainty about the extent of interna-
tional introductions, domestic spread, and community transmis-
sion of the SARS-CoV-2 variant. There have been 2,672 reported
COVID-19 cases associated with B.1.1.7 from 48 states (as of
March 6, 2021) (CDC, 2021a), but these numbers are likely sub-
stantial underestimates. Approaches to enhance depth in certain
populations and geographies may be required to address such
uncertainty. Regardless, the existing framework limits the imple-
mentation of effective public health actions, such as targeted
public health messaging and enhanced mitigation (Grubaugh
et al., 2021), and allows B.1.1.7 to spread unimpeded (Galloway
et al., 2021). The continued rise in B.1.1.7 cases may increase

the burden on the US healthcare system
and enable further evolution of mutations
of public health concern (Wise, 2021).
Here, to investigate the locations of
B.1.1.7 introductions into the US, to iden-
tify signiﬁcant surveillance gaps, and to
provide evidence for community transmis-
sion and domestic spread, we combined
data from UK air travel into US airports,
SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing, and clinical diagnostics.
We identiﬁed where B.1.1.7 introductions were most likely to
have occurred and where surveillance for B.1.1.7 cases could
be immediately supported. Combining our work with other ana-
lyses (Washington et al., 2021), we found that B.1.1.7 became
independently established in parts of the US starting in early
December 2020, and community transmission from some of
these sources has already led to interstate spread. Finally, our
TaqPath SGTF data indicate that the frequency of B.1.1.7 is
rapidly rising, and we project that it will become the dominant
SARS-CoV-2 lineage in many states by mid- to late March
2021. Thus, enhanced surveillance and control measures are ur-
gently needed to mitigate B.1.1.7 leading to a resurgence of co-
ronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the US.
RESULTS
Locations of potential B.1.1.7 introductions from
international travelers
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, international travel can
seed the local establishment of new SARS-CoV-2 variants.
Thus, to obtain a relative estimate of where B.1.1.7 introductions
were most likely to occur, we analyzed air passenger travel vol-
umes from December 2020 coming into all US airports from the
initial primary source of the variant, the UK (Figure 1; showing top
15 airports). This period, December 2020, is when B.1.1.7 was
rapidly expanding in the UK (Davies et al., 2021; Volz et al.,
2021) and when we expect the ﬁrst introductions to be occurring

within the US. We found that the airports with the largest passen-
ger volumes as a ﬁnal destination from the UK were New York
JFK (7,687), Los Angeles (3,541), Newark Liberty (3,371), Boston
Logan (3,216), Washington Dulles (2,680), and Miami (2,604)
(Figure 1C; full list shown in Data S1). We then implemented a
probabilistic choice behavior model to estimate where air pas-
sengers may travel after reaching their ﬁnal airport destination
(Huber et al., 2021). Thus, by estimating the catchment of each
airport, we created a county-level risk map for where early inter-
national B.1.1.7 introductions may have occurred within the US
(Figures 1A and 1B). After summing the risks across all counties,
we predict the highest importation risks in New York, California,
Florida, Texas, New Jersey, and Massachusetts.
We focused our analysis on travelers entering the US from the
UK. For completeness, however, we also obtained air passenger
volumes from other countries that also reported B.1.1.7 cases in
December 2020: Germany, Denmark, and the United Arab Emir-
ates (https://outbreak.info/situation-reports/; Table S1). The to-
tal number of air passenger travelers from the UK to the US in
December was 45,282, which is greater than the number coming
from Germany (31,486), Denmark (5,544), and the United Arab
Emirates (15,291); and the majority of the travelers arrived at
similar airports (New York JFK, Newark Liberty, Chicago
O’Hare, Washington Dulles, and Los Angeles). Finally, the fre-
quency of B.1.1.7 was likely higher in the UK compared to other
countries during this time, and thus the risk to travelers was
greater. Therefore, we did not include other countries of origin
in our ﬂight-based importation risk assessment as they would
be unlikely to change our ﬁndings of where B.1.1.7 importations
would occur in the US (Figure 1).
Genomic surveillance gaps and potential
underreporting of B.1.1.7 cases
As of March 6, 2021, 2,672 B.1.1.7 cases from 48 states have
been identiﬁed in the US (CDC, 2021a). These numbers, howev-
er, are likely signiﬁcantly underreported, as whole-genome
sequencing is needed for B.1.1.7 conﬁrmation. To identify where
B.1.1.7 cases may be disproportionately underreported during
the early phases of B.1.1.7 emergence in the US (Figure 2), we
evaluated the intensity of SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance
for each state and compared that to our ﬂight-based risk esti-
mates of where early B.1.1.7 outbreaks may have occurred
(Figure 1).
We started by evaluating the percentage of sequenced SARS-
CoV-2 clinical samples relative to the number of reported
COVID-19 cases (Figures 2A and S1). For this, we downloaded
(1) all SARS-CoV-2 genomes available on GISAID (https://
www.gisaid.org; accessed March 4, 2021) with ‘‘USA’’ listed as
a location and (2) the total number of new COVID-19 cases for
each state from December 2020 to February 2021 (https://
covidtracking.com; accessed on March 4, 2021; Data S1). For
this 3-month period, which was crucial for B.1.1.7 introductions
and establishment, we found that an average of only 0.43% of
the US COVID-19 cases were sequenced and posted on GISAID.
As sample testing, transport, sequencing, analysis, and data
submission can take multiple days to weeks, more data from
this time period will likely be available in the near future. This
delay can be seen for most states, which have a relatively lower
percentage of sequenced cases available for February than
January (Figure S1). Still, there are 24 states with less than
0.43% of the COVID-19 cases with available SARS-CoV-2 se-
quences during December 2020 to February 2021, including 9
states that have not submitted any B.1.1.7 sequences (Figure 2A
and S1; Data S1).
While a low fraction of sequenced COVID-19 cases will
certainly hinder the detection of B.1.1.7 and other variants of
concern, these data alone may not indicate where B.1.1.7 may
be disproportionately underreported. Therefore, we compared
our risk estimates of B.1.1.7 introductions using air passenger
volumes from the UK to all SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2B; Data S1)
and B.1.1.7 (Figure 2C; Data S1) genomes sequenced per state.
Of the states receiving more than 2,000 air passengers from the
UK, we found that COVID-19 cases from New Jersey (0.17% of
cases sequenced), Illinois (0.29%), Florida (0.32%), and Virginia
(0.37%) have been sequenced below the 0.43% national
average (Figure 2B). In Florida, many of the available SARS-
CoV-2 sequences were targeted using TaqPath SGTF results,
and thus, they have sequenced 373 B.1.1.7 genomes to date,
the most in the country (Figure 2C). In places like New Jersey, Il-
linois, and Virginia, however, if SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveil-
lance could be increased, it might determine if B.1.1.7 cases
are disproportionately underreported as compared to New
York and California.
Phylogenetic evidence for multiple B.1.1.7
introductions and interstate spread
Our travel data indicated that we should have observed many
separate and sustained B.1.1.7 introductions within the US
from the UK and perhaps other international locations where
the variant may be circulating. To investigate if some of these in-
troductions led to community transmission and/or interstate
spread
within
the
US,
we
combined
our
SARS-CoV-2
sequencing data from the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC; 568 sequences), Yale University (116), Univer-
sity of Michigan (45), and New York State Department of Health
(41). Our phylogenetic analysis of these sequences suggests
that there were many separate introductions into the US that
led to secondary transmission and that some sustained intro-
ductions within states were likely from domestic spread
(Figure 3).
We generated or received permission to use 770 B.1.1.7 ge-
nomes collected from December 19, 2020 to February 14, 2021
from the following states: Florida (267), California (133), Illinois
(64), New York (49), Michigan (48), Connecticut (47), Texas (45),
New Jersey (35), Georgia (33), Pennsylvania (11), North Carolina
(10), Louisiana (9), Indiana (4), Massachusetts (4), Minnesota (3),
Tennessee (3), Oklahoma (2), Colorado (1), New Hampshire (1),
and Virginia (1). From a larger dataset of 101,079 B.1.1.7 genomes
available up to February 26, 2021, we generated a smaller set of
8,864 B.1.1.7 genomes from 59 countries (7,589 from interna-
tional locations and 1,275 from the US; Figure S2) using a sub-
sampling method based on COVID-19 incidence (see STAR
Methods). We further reduced this tree to a representative set
of 1,908 genomes, which included our data and 1,139 B.1.1.7 ge-
nomes available from the UK and other countries to infer a time-
scaled maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree. We subsequently

conducted discrete phylogeographic analysis of our ﬁxed time-
scaled maximum-likelihood tree using a Bayesian approach (Del-
licour et al., 2020; Lemey et al., 2009) to identify descending
clades that likely represent distinct introductions into US states
(Figure 3). Furthermore, to identify B.1.1.7 introductions that likely
led to secondary community transmission, we limited our analysis
to descending clades originating in the US with (1) three or more
sequences, (2) >70 bootstrap support, and (3) >70% discrete
state probability within the US at the most recent common
ancestor (MRCA). Based on these criteria and by performing
ancestral trait reconstruction using BEAST, we found 23 distinct
B.1.1.7 introductions in the US that led to secondary transmission
(Figure 3B). From these descending clades, we estimate that the
median times to the MRCA (tMRCA) and, by proxy, the estimated
times in which B.1.1.7 became locally established occurred
throughout early December to January (Figure 3B; Data S1). Spe-
ciﬁcally, from clades with more than 15 sequences, we estimate
B.1.1.7 establishment in Florida by early December (clade
size = 243; 90% conﬁdence interval [CI] = 2020-11-25 to 2020-
12-11), New York by mid-December (38; 2020-12-16, 2020-12-

and New Jersey/Connecticut by early January (34; 2020-12-28 to
2021-01-06; Data S1). By comparison, Washington et al. esti-
mated the tMRCA for the Florida clade to be December 3 (95%
highest posterior probability: 2020-11-22 to 2020-12-11) (Wash-
ington et al., 2021), which is within days of our estimate. They
also document a sustained B.1.1.7 introduction into California
during early December (Washington et al., 2021), a clade with
91 genomes that can be visualized in Figure 3A, which did not
get included as an introduction in our analysis as it did not meet
our criteria of >70 bootstrap support.
We also discovered several instances of likely B.1.1.7 inter-
state spread that occurred between December 2020 and
January 2021 (Figures 3C–3H). For example, we found regional
spread within New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut (Figures
3C and 3D), which is expected based on their connectedness
among travelers (Figure 1B), and that New York was a regional
‘‘hub’’ for SARS-CoV-2 spread during the early pandemic (Gon-
zalez-Reiche et al., 2020; Maurano et al., 2020). We also found
evidence for regional spread between Texas and Louisiana (Fig-
ure 3E) and from Florida to several other states in the Southeast
US (Figure 3G), which is further supported by independent ﬁnd-
ings of a ‘‘Southeast’’ B.1.1.7 clade (Washington et al., 2021).
Finally, our data suggest that out-of-region spread has also
occurred from the New York/New Jersey/Connecticut region
to Michigan (Figure 3D; tMRCA 90% CI, 2020-12-24 to 2021-
01-07) and from Florida to Illinois (Figure 3H; 2020-12-25 to
2021-01-01). Additional examples can be found by exploring
our full dataset (https://nextstrain.org/community/grubaughlab/
CT-SARS-CoV-2/paper5).
Our estimates of international and domestic introductions, how-
ever, can be signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by sampling biases and gaps,
sequencing and processing errors, and the imperfection of esti-
mating transitions between locations among sequences with low
genetic diversity. Moreover, based on the low rate of sequencing
of COVID-19 cases in the US (Figure 2A), the true number of inter-
national and domestic introductions are likely signiﬁcantly higher
than what we report. Importantly, though, our results inform us
that many sustained B.1.1.7 introductions occurred throughout
the country, with some likely occurring weeks before the ﬁrst
COVID-19 cases associated with B.1.1.7 were reported in the
US during late December (Zimmer and Pietsch, 2020).
Diagnostic evidence for increased community
transmission of B.1.1.7
Our phylogenetic analysis and those by our colleagues (Wash-
ington et al., 2021) indicate that the B.1.1.7 introductions that
led to community transmission in the US began around early
December 2020 (Figure 3). To investigate if B.1.1.7 has
increased in frequency since these introductions, we used the
TaqPath assay SGTF results from COVID-19 clinical samples
(Figure 4). As the spike gene D69/70 HV deletion in B.1.1.7 ge-
nomes causes SGTF results when using the TaqPath assay,
tracking the occurrence of SGTF can provide an indirect mea-
sure of changes in B.1.1.7 population frequency (Borges et al.,
2021; Volz et al., 2021). Our SGTF data suggest that B.1.1.7 is
increasing in frequency in all four states investigated (Connecti-
cut, New York, New Jersey, and Illinois) and will likely become
the majority SARS-CoV-2 lineage between mid- and late March
2021, in line with other estimates (Washington et al., 2021).
We obtained 422,330 TaqPath COVID-19 RT-PCR test results
performed by Tempus and Yale New Haven Hospital clinical
diagnostic laboratories from December 2020 through February
2021 on nasal swab samples collected from four states: Illinois
(183,077 tests), Connecticut (139,403), New Jersey (58,675),
and New York (41,175). The weekly SARS-CoV-2 test positivity
rate varied across the states and months, but all were high
(>8%) in late December to early January (Figure 4A; Data S1).
From our tested samples from Illinois and Connecticut, we saw
a notable decrease in the percentage of SARS-CoV-2-positive
test results that follow the national trends.
Among the positive test results, the frequency of SGTF results
remained low (<2%) until late January when they dramatically
rose to 10%–25% across all states by late February (Figure 4B).
During January 2021, only 47% (54/116) of the SGTF samples
presented in Figure 4B that we sequenced were identiﬁed as
B.1.1.7, while the majority were SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.375,
which also has the spike gene D69/70 HV deletion that causes
SGTF (Larsen and Worobey, 2020; Moreno et al., 2021). In
February, however, we found that 90% (254/282) of the SGTF
samples that we sequenced were B.1.1.7, including 100%
(147/147) from February 15 to 23. Thus, the proportion of
SARS-CoV-2-positive samples generating a SGTF result are
on the rise across several states, and SGTF is becoming a
near-direct measure of B.1.1.7.
Next, we wanted to estimate when we should expect B.1.1.7
to become the majority SARS-CoV-2 lineage among the tested
populations represented by our data. We ﬁt our SGTF data to
a logistic regression model showing an exponential increase in
the percentage of SGTF results among the positive test results,
representing an exponential growth of B.1.1.7 across all sites
(Figure 4C). From this analysis, we estimate that SGTF results
will reach the 50% threshold during the week of March 7, 2021
in Connecticut, March 21 in New York, and March 28 in Illinois
and New Jersey. Furthermore, we estimate that SGTF results,
and by proxy B.1.1.7, will reach the 75% threshold of positive
cases �2 weeks later. Thus, by mid-April, parts of the COVID-
19 pandemic in the US will be dominated by the transmission
properties of B.1.1.7.

DISCUSSION
Despite travel restrictions and increased testing requirements,
we found evidence for a large number of independent B.1.1.7 in-
troductions into the US, many of which have led to secondary
community transmission. Incoming air passenger volumes
from the UK predict that New York, California, and Florida would
be at highest risk for importation, and ﬁnding the earliest B.1.1.7
introductions (Washington et al., 2021) and the high numbers of
B.1.1.7 sequences from these states agree with that hypothesis.

Indeed,
our
phylogenetic
analyses
suggest that in addition to separate intro-
duction events, B.1.1.7 became indepen-
dently established across the country
starting in early December 2020, weeks
before the ﬁrst reported case in the US
on December 29, 2020 (Zimmer and
Pietsch, 2020). Around the same time,
we found several examples of within-re-
gion interstate spread of B.1.1.7 in the
Northeast, Southeast, and Southern US
and
some
examples
of
out-of-region
spread from the Northeast and Southeast
to the Midwest. This period of ‘‘silent’’
spread across the US is reminiscent of
the early 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in
the US when diagnostic testing was low
(Fauver et al., 2020). Overall, our data
highlight the relative ease with which
SARS-CoV-2 variants can spread unde-
tected throughout the US, particularly in
areas where genomic surveillance efforts
are minimal.
COVID-19 cases associated with the
B.1.1.7 variant are likely signiﬁcantly under-
reported across the US. This is because, as
a whole, only �0.43% of the COVID-19
cases in the US were sequenced from
December 2020 to February 2021, which included the period
with the highest case rates in the country. The sequencing capac-
ity is highly variable across the country, and our travel data help to
identify regions that may be disproportionately underreporting
cases of B.1.1.7 and where it would be prudent to immediately pri-
oritize variant surveillance.States such as New Jersey, Illinois, and
Virginia received moderately high levels of UK travel yet reported a
low proportion of sequenced COVID-19 cases from recent
months, presenting the likelihood that B.1.1.7 is signiﬁcantly
underdetected in these regions.

Article
It is estimated that 5% of the COVID-19 cases should be
sequenced to detect emerging variants when they exist at a
prevalence of 0.1% to 1.0% (Vavrek et al., 2021). With the nation-
wide decrease in COVID-19 cases since reaching a new peak in
early January 2021 and the initiatives to increase the capacity of
SARS-CoV-2 sequencing within state public health laboratories
(CDC, 2021b), there should be a considerable increase in the
proportion of COVID-19 cases sequenced in the US during com-
ing months. However, we should not expect an immediate jump
to that 5% threshold, and we will need to supplement
sequencing
with
other
more
conventional
laboratory
ap-
proaches. In the UK, the frequency of B.1.1.7 was primarily
tracked across locations using SGTF results from the TaqPath
COVID-19 PCR assay (Borges et al., 2021; Volz et al., 2021).
Here, we also demonstrate how SGTF data can help to provide
insights on B.1.1.7 population frequency changes and how these
results can help to prioritize samples for sequencing. In fact,
Florida also received a high volume of UK travel (ranked #3 in
the US) and has a low overall rate of virus sequencing (0.32%
of cases sequenced, ranked #29), but targeted sequencing of
SGTF samples has helped identify a large number of B.1.1.7
cases in this state (373, ranked #1) (Washington et al., 2021).
While TaqPath SGTF results are not deﬁnitive for B.1.1.7 (Larsen
and Worobey, 2020; Moreno et al., 2021), as its frequency
climbs, SGTF data become closer to a proxy for B.1.1.7 pres-
ence.
Thus,
the
TaqPath
clinical
diagnostic
assay,
plus
research-use only PCR assays that are more speciﬁc for
B.1.1.7 detection (and can also detect other current variants of
concern) (Vogels et al., 2021), could provide immediate data to
guide public health decision-making, especially in areas where
B.1.1.7 cases may be disproportionately underestimated.
The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant of concern has become es-
tablished in many states within the US. Our data and those of
our colleagues (Washington et al., 2021) indicate that B.1.1.7 is
expanding at an exponential rate and that it will be the dominant
SARS-CoV-2 lineage in many places across the US by March or
April 2021. While surveillance gaps across the US mean that
some communities do not have direct evidence for local
B.1.1.7 emergence, it should be assumed that community
B.1.1.7 transmission is widespread. With several US states
announcing loosening restrictions on gatherings (including res-
taurants), restrictions on travel, and/or mask requirements, and
with sufﬁcient COVID-19 vaccine coverage to reach population
immunity still many months away (summer/fall 2021), the near-
term impact of B.1.1.7 may be signiﬁcant. We must use this
opportunity to reinforce communications and messaging sur-
rounding the importance of mitigation measures to prevent this
variant from exacerbating an already crippling pandemic (Gru-
baugh et al., 2021). In reality, it is difﬁcult to implement new mea-
sures without supporting data, especially if they impact schools
or businesses. Thus, increasing surveillance for B.1.1.7 and
other variants through sequencing and more conventional
methods should be made a high priority (CDC, 2021b).
Limitations of the study
Our study has important limitations. First, our importation risk
analysis did not account for the likelihood of transmission among
the different regions in the US. As COVID-19 cases were at or
near their peak across the country, our assumption was that
transmission potential was high everywhere, and that the
numbers of potentially infected travelers were a more signiﬁcant
factor. In reality, local conditions and behaviors play an impor-
tant role for B.1.1.7 establishment, and could explain why
B.1.1.7 cases are low in some states as opposed to surveillance
deﬁciencies. Second, while we provide substantial evidence for
several independent introductions, increased community trans-
mission, and domestic spread, the signiﬁcant undersampling
that we discuss throughout this manuscript highlights that these
events are likely underestimated. As we generate more data, we
will be able to reveal additional insights into the patterns of
B.1.1.7 spread across the US and the level to which B.1.1.7
will achieve dominance in different regions.

Residual portions of respiratory specimens from individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR were obtained from
the Wadsworth Center and partnering clinical laboratories. This work was approved by the New York State Department of Health
Institutional Review Board, under study numbers 02-054 and 07-022.
This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.
METHOD DETAILS
Flight volumes and maps
The ﬂight travel volume data were provided by OAG Aviation Worldwide Ltd. OAG Trafﬁc Analyzer, Version 2.5.11 2020 (http://
analytics.oag.com/analyzer-client/home; accessed 2020-02-22). Travel volume numbers are modeled estimates based on ticket
sales and reporting from airline carriers. Travel volume represents the aggregate number of passenger journeys, not necessarily
unique individuals. A subset of the available data was used only to capture ﬂights whose origin was the UK and whose ﬁnal desti-
nation was an airport in the US for ﬂights that occurred in December 2020.The map presented in Figures 1A and 1B, which shows
the approximate ﬁnal destinations of the estimated number of people per county who ﬂew into the top 15 airports in the US on ﬂights
inbound from the UK in December 2020 and overlaid onto a map of the US, was generated using R, with the maps, choroplethr, and
ggplot2 packages (Becker et al., 2018; Wickham, 2016). The UK inbound ﬂight volume data per airport in the US are displayed in
Figure 1C. These data were also used to calculate the total travelers from the UK per state and was used to generate Figures 2B
and 2C.
Sample selection, screening, and sequencing
Yale University
Sample selection and RNA extraction.
Samples were received in partnership with various clinical laboratories as either puriﬁed RNA
or original nasal swab in viral transport media. Samples were screened for S-gene target failure (SGFT) using the Thermo Fisher Taq-
Path COVID-19 Combo Kit diagnostic assay prior to receipt at Yale. Nucleic acid was extracted from original samples (300 mL) using
the MagMAX viral/pathogen nucleic acid isolation kit (Thermo Fisher) and eluted into 75 mL. All RNA was then screened again using an
assay developed by our laboratory that is speciﬁc for variants of concern (Vogels et al., 2021). Samples identiﬁed by the screen as
potential variants were then prioritized for sequencing. Multiple extraction controls were included for each RNA extraction batch and
tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by the same assay.
Oxford Nanopore library preparation and sequencing.
RNA extracted from positive samples served as the input for an amplicon-
based approach for sequencing on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT; Oxford, United Kingdom) MinION (Quick et al.,
2017). Sequencing libraries were prepared using the ONT Ligation Sequencing Kit (SQK-LSK109) and the ONT Native Barcoding
Expansion pack as described in the ARTIC Network’s protocol with V3 primers (IDT) (Quick, 2020) with the following modiﬁcations:
cDNA was generated with SuperScriptIV VILO Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA), all amplicons were gener-
ated using 35 cycles of ampliﬁcation, amplicons were then normalized to 15 ng for each sample, end repair incubation time was
increased to 25 min followed by an additional bead-based clean up, and all clean up steps used a ratio of 1:1 beads:sample. No-
template controls were introduced for each run at the cDNA synthesis and amplicon synthesis steps and were taken through the
entire library preparation and sequencing protocol to detect any cross-contamination. For each control in each run, less than
1,000 total reads were observed. A subset of reads in control samples aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 genome, although no position
of the genome had greater than 20 reads i.e., enough data to inﬂuence the generation of a consensus genome. 25 ng of the ﬁnal library
was loaded on a MinION R9.4.1 ﬂow cell and sequenced for approximately 8-10 hours.
Bioinformatics processing.
The RAMPART application from the ARTIC Network was used to monitor approximate genome
coverage for each sample and control in real time during the sequencing run (http://github.com/artic-network/rampart). Fast5
ﬁles were basecalled using the Guppy basecaller 4.4.0 fast model and consensus genomes were generated according to the
ARTIC bioinformatic pipeline (http://artic.network/ncov-2019/ncov2019-bioinformatics-sop.html) which uses Nanopolish to call
variants (Loman et al., 2015). A threshold of 20x coverage was required for each amplicon to be included in the consensus
genome.
University of Michigan
Sample selection and amplicon generation.
All available specimens in the month of January were prepared for sequencing. Resid-
ual transport media or saliva was centrifuged at 1200 x g. and aliquoted. For nasopharyngeal and sputum specimens, RNA was ex-
tracted with the Invitrogen PureLink Pro 96 Viral RNA/DNA Puriﬁcation Kit (200 mL of input sample eluted in 100 mL) or the QIAamp
Viral RNA Mini kit (140 mL of input sample eluted in 50 mL). For saliva specimens, RNA was extracted with the Thermo Fisher MagMAX
Viral RNA Isolation Kit (200 mL of input sample eluted in 50 mL). Extracted RNA was reverse transcribed with SuperScript IV (Thermo
Fisher). For each sample, 1 mL of random hexamers and 1 mL of 10 mM dNTP were added to 11 mL of RNA, heated at 65�C for 5 min,
and placed on ice for 1 min. Then a reverse transcription master mix was added (4 mL of SuperScript IV buffer, 1 mL of 0.1M DTT, 1 mL
of RNaseOUT RNase inhibitor, and 1 mL of SSIV reverse transcriptase) and incubated at 42�C for 50 min, 70�C for 10 min, and held at
4�C. SARS-CoV-2 cDNA was ampliﬁed in two multiplex PCR reactions with the ARTIC Network version 3 primer pools and protocol.

Viral cDNA was ampliﬁed with the Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB) with the following thermocycler protocol: 98�C
for 30 s, then 35 cycles of 98�C for 15 s, 63�C for 5 min, and ﬁnal hold at 4�C. Reaction products for a given sample were pooled
together in equal volumes.
Illumina library preparation and sequencing.
Pooled PCR product was puriﬁed with 1X volume of AMPure beads (Beckman-
Coulter). Sequencing libraries were prepared with the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit (NEB) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Barcoded libraries were pooled in equal volume and extracted with a 1% agarose gel to remove adaptor dimers. Pooled
libraries were quantiﬁed with the Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq (v2
chemistry, 2x250 cycles) at the University of Michigan Microbiome Core facility. Reads were aligned to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference
genome (GenBank MN908947.3) with BWA-MEM version 0.7.15. Sequencing adaptors and ampliﬁcation primer sequences were
trimmed with iVar 1.2.1. Consensus sequences were called with iVar 1.2.1 by simple majority at each position (> 50% frequency),
placing an ambiguous N at positions with fewer than 10 reads.
Oxford Nanopore library preparation and sequencing.
After multiplex PCR ampliﬁcation, libraries were prepared for sequencing
with the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION using the ARTIC Network version 3 protocol (Quick, 2020). Samples were prepared
in batches of 24 with one-pot native barcoding. Pooled PCR products were diluted in nuclease-free water with a dilution factor of 10.
Amplicon ends were prepared for ligation with the NEBNext Ultra II End Repair/dA-Tailing Module (NEB). Unique barcodes (Oxford
Nanopore Native Barcoding Expansion kits) were ligated per sample with the NEB Blunt/TA Ligase Master Mix. After barcoding, re-
actions were pooled together in equal volumes and puriﬁed barcoded amplicons with 0.4X volume of AMPure beads. Oxford Nano-
pore sequencing adapters were ligated with the NEBNext Quick Ligation Module (NEB) and the library was puriﬁed with 1X volume of
AMPure beads. Final libraries were quantiﬁed with the Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher). Each library (15-20 ng) was
loaded onto a ﬂow cell (FLO-MIN106) and sequenced with the MinION.
Bioinformatics processing.
Sequencing progress was monitored with RAMPART. Basecalling was performed with Guppy v4.0.14
and consensus genomes were called using the ARTIC Network bioinformatics pipeline (http://artic.network/ncov-2019/
ncov2019-bioinformatics-sop.html).
New York State Department of Health, Wadsworth Center
Sample selection and RNA extraction.
Respiratory swabs in viral transport medium previously identiﬁed as SARS-CoV-2 positive by
real-time RT-PCR were selected for sequencing, and included specimens received and tested in the Wadsworth Virology Laboratory
and those submitted by clinical laboratories. An enhanced surveillance program was initiated in December 2020 and included retro-
spective sequencing of positive samples dating back to September 2020. Samples were generally required to have real-time Ct
values less than 30 and minimal residual volumes of 100 mL. Most nucleic acid extractions were performed on a Roche MagNAPure
96 with the Viral NA Small Volume Kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) with 100mL sample input and 100mL eluate. Samples of special
concern with Ct values in the low 30 s were extracted on a NUCLISENS easyMAG instrument (bioMerieux, Durham, NC) with
1,000 mL sample input and 25 mL eluate.
Illumina library preparation and sequencing.
Extracted RNA was processed for whole genome sequencing with a modiﬁed ARTIC
protocol (http://artic.network/ncov-2019) in the Applied Genomics Technology Core at the Wadsworth Center. Brieﬂy, cDNA was
synthesized with SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and random hexamers. Amplicons were
generated by pooled PCR with two premixed ARTIC V3 primer pools (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA, USA). Additional
primers to supplement those showing poor ampliﬁcation efﬁciency (http://github.com/artic-network/artic-ncov2019/tree/master/
primer_schemes/nCoV-2019) were added separately to the pooled stocks. PCR conditions were 98�C for 30 s, 24 cycles of 98�C
for 15 s/63�C for 5 min, and a ﬁnal 65�C extension for 5 min. Amplicons from pool 1 and pool 2 reactions were combined and puriﬁed
by AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) with a 1X bead-to-sample ratio and eluted in 10mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The
amplicons were quantiﬁed using Quant-IT dsDNA Assay Kit on an ARVO X3 Multimode Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA,
USA). Illumina sequencing libraries were generated using the Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep Kit with Illumina Index Adaptors and
sequenced on a MiSeq instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).
Oxford Nanopore library preparation and sequencing.
RNA was processed using the same ARTIC V3 protocol as described for Il-
lumina library preparation. MinION libraries for up to 24 samples were generated according to the COVID-19 PCR tiling protocol
(ONT). Native barcodes (ONT EXP-NBD104 and EXP-NBD114) were ligated to each DNA sample with NEB Blunt/TA Ligase Master
Mix. Amplicons were pooled and puriﬁed using 0.4X AMPure XP beads and short-fragment buffer (ONT EXP-SFB001). Oxford Nano-
pore sequencing adapters were ligated with NEBNext Quick Ligation Module (NEB) and libraries were puriﬁed with 0.4X AMPure XP
beads. About 15-25ng of each library was loaded on a FLO-MIN106 ﬂowcell and sequenced with the MinION. Basecalling was per-
formed by Guppy v4.2.3.
Bioinformatics processing.
Illumina libraries were processed with ARTIC nextﬂow pipeline (http://github.com/connor-lab/
ncov2019-artic-nf/tree/illumina, last updated April 2020). Brieﬂy, reads were trimmed with TrimGalore (http://github.com/
FelixKrueger/TrimGalore) and aligned to the reference assembly MN908947.3 (strain Wuhan-Hu-1) by BWA (Li & Durbin 2010).
Primers were trimmed with iVar (Grubaugh et al., 2019) and variants were called with samtools mpileup function (Li et al., 2009),
the output of which was used by iVar to generate consensus sequences. Positions were required to be covered by a minimum depth
of 50 reads and variants were required to be present at a frequency R 0.75. Consensus sequences were generated by the ARTIC
bioinformatic pipeline v1.1.3 with Medaka variant calling (http://artic.network/ncov-2019/ncov2019-bioinformatics-sop.html) for
Oxford Nanopore libraries.

COVID-19 clinical samples sequenced by the CDC or sponsored by the CDC were generated for other purposes and shared with our
teams via GISAID (gisaid.org). See elsewhere for some of the sequencing methodology and data processing (Washington
et al., 2021).
COVID-19 PCR testing and SGTF determination
Routine clinical COVID-19 diagnostic testing was performed in Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) regu-
lated laboratories at Yale University, Yale New Haven Hospital, and Tempus Labs following Emergency Use Authorization protocols
submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration for use of the Applied Biosystems TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (catalog number
A47814). SGTF results were deﬁned as any SARS-CoV-2 positive sample with N or ORF1AB Ct < 30 and S gene undetermined. The
data were aggregated on a week and state level for surveillance purposes.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Airport catchment model
The Huff model is a probabilistic approach which is traditionally used to determine the probability that a given population will go to a
speciﬁc service location (Huff, 1963, 2003). Recently it has been applied to determine airport catchment areas, i.e., the location
someone will go after arriving at a certain airport (Huber et al., 2021). This approach incorporates the distance from an airport to sur-
rounding counties (or other geographical units such as census tract) and the attractiveness of that airport. The Huff model is repre-
sented as (Huff, 2003):
Pij =
Sa
j
Db
ij
Pn
i = 1
Sa
j
Db
ij
Where Pij represents the probability that individuals that arrive at airport j will go to county i, Sj is a measure of attractiveness for airport
j, Dij is the distance from county i to airport j,a is an airport attractiveness exponent, and b is the distance decay exponent. As a proxy
for Sj we use the number of passengers arriving at airport j from the United Kingdom in December 2020. Based on previous analysis
optimizing the Huff model for airport catchment models, we set a to 1 and b to 2.
Huber and Rinner recommended the use of a distance cut-off so that the catchment area represents a reasonable maximum dis-
tance that a person would be willing to travel from an airport (Huber and Rinner, 2020). We selected a distance cut-off of 200km,
because this represents a conservative estimate of which counties surrounding each airport are most likely for people to travel to
once they deplane (Huber et al., 2021). Using ﬂight data from OAG, we selected airports in the US that received at least one percent
of the total passengers from the UK in December 2020. We utilized a Huff model for each of these airports, and combined these re-
sults to estimate the approximate number of people in the counties surrounding the airports that traveled from the UK. These results
are displayed in Figures 1A and 1B.
Phylogenetic analysis
To perform phylogenetic analyses, we initially built a dataset containing only B.1.1.7 genomes (genomes, n = 101,079) based on data
available up to February 26, 2021 on GISAID (gisaid.org). Since the proportion of B.1.1.7 cases is not known for most countries, we
subsampled this set of genomes according to the proportion of overall COVID-19 cases reported per epidemiological week in each
country, using data from the Johns Hopkins University, Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) (http://github.com/
CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). The subsampling was performed using the pipeline ‘subsampler’ (http://github.com/andersonbrito/
subsampler), which selected available genomes simulating a scenario of 0.1% of sequenced cases per epiweek, per country.
This allowed us to obtain a dataset with 8,864 B.1.1.7 genomes from 59 countries (7,589 international, and 1,275 from the US, all
with coverage above 70%), representative of the COVID-19 burden revealed by the epidemiological time series data from each
country. As part of this dataset, there were 770 genomes that we sequenced from 20 US states from 2020-12-19 to 2021-02-14, pro-
vided by the CDC (568), New York State Department of Health (41), University of Michigan (45), and Yale University (116). The B.1.1.7
samples sequenced by the CDC were generated for public health surveillance, and we received direct permission to download the
sequences from GISAID for primary analysis. The ﬁnal dataset was composed by 8,864 B.1.1.7 genomes, and one P.1 genome to
root the tree, serving as an outgroup (Brazil/AM-20842882CA/2020). The complete list of genomes, with author acknowledgments,
can be found in Data S2.
Using an augur pipeline (Hadﬁeld et al., 2018), we performed multiple sequence alignment (MSA) using MAFFT (Katoh and Stand-
ley, 2013), and the 50 and 30 ends of the MSA were masked alongside other problematic sites (De Maio et al., 2020) using a script
provided with the pipeline. A quick maximum likelihood analysis was performed using IQ-Tree (Minh et al., 2020) under a GTR nucle-
otide substitution model. Inference of divergence times and reconstruction of ancestral states were performed using TreeTime 0.8.0
(Sagulenko et al., 2018). This preliminary analysis aimed at determining the placement of the US B.1.1.7 genomes with respect to
international samples (Figure S2), and at removing major molecular clock outliers (n = 34) deviating more than 4 interquartile ranges
from the root-to-tip regression line. This phylogeny was then used for identifying large clades containing only genomes of European

Article
or Global origin, which were then individually pruned down to contain only three representatives per clade. This procedure dramat-
ically decreased the total number of genomes in the dataset from 8,864 to 1,913, while still keeping the same overall topology. The
smaller dataset (1,913 B.1.1.7 genomes) was then run through the same pipeline as described above, but with 1,000 UFBoot
replicates during tree inference using IQ-Tree (Minh et al., 2013). This tree served as input for a root-to-tip analysis using TempEst
(Rambaut et al., 2016), where 5 outliers with residual above ± 0.0002 subs/site were removed (Figure S3). With a clean set of 1,908
genomes, we proceeded with the inference of the ﬁnal time-scaled tree using TreeTime (Sagulenko et al., 2018).
Finally, using the time-scaled maximum-likelihood tree as a ﬁxed topology, we performed Bayesian inference of ancestral states
(discrete phylogeographic reconstruction) using BEAST v.1.10 (Suchard et al., 2018), for 15x106 generations, sampling every 1,000
generations, which led to MCMC convergence and good mixing, with all parameters showing ESS > 200 when assessed using Tracer
1.7 (Rambaut et al., 2018). After discarding 10% of the sampled trees as burn-in, we used TreeAnnotator to obtain the ﬁnal tree, iden-
tical to the TreeTime output, but with ancestral states inferred by BEAST. We visualized this time-scaled maximum-likelihood
phylogeny using auspice (Hadﬁeld et al., 2018), which can be found on our custom nextstrain page: http://nextstrain.org/
community/grubaughlab/CT-SARS-CoV-2/paper5. We combined bootstrap support and Bayesian inference of ancestral states
with our time-scaled maximum-likelihood tree shown in Figure 3 using baltic (https://github.com/evogytis/baltic). To identify inde-
pendent, international introductions of B.1.1.7 in the US, we selected well supported clades (UFBoot > 70; MRCA discrete state
probability > 0.7) with 3 or more taxa and represented these clades in Figure 3B using the ‘‘exploded tree view’’ from baltic
(http://phylo-baltic.github.io/baltic-gallery/basic-exploded-tree-ﬂu/), to highlight changes in ancestral state (International origin >
USA). The clades shown in Figures 3C–3G are zoom highlights from the large tree shown in Figure 3A.
To externally validate the timescale and tMRCA estimates from TreeTime, we utilized the dataset used in the inference of the
Bayesian MCC tree generated by Washington et al. (https://github.com/andersen-lab/paper_2021_early-b117-usa) to reconstruct
a similar time-resolved phylogeny using TreeTime for comparison. We analyzed 4 separate US clades using both methods and found
that they produced similar mean tMRCAs and overlapping temporal distributions (Figure S4).
Finally, in order to compare the discrete ancestral state reconstructions fully inferred using TreeTime 0.8.0 with inferences done
using BEAST v.1.10, we plotted the results from TimeTree using the same approach used to generate Figure 3, to create Figure S5,
to highlight that results obtained through maximum-likelihood analysis (using TreeTime) is equivalent to those obtained in more
computing intensive Bayesian analysis (using BEAST). The results presented in Figure 3 use BEAST for the discrete ancestral state
reconstructions.
Projection of SGTF data
A logistic growth model was ﬁt to the weekly SGTF quantiﬁcation for each state using the glm() function from the stats package in R.

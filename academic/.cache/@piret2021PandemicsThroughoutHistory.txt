Pandemics Throughout History

The emergence and spread of infectious diseases with pandemic potential occurred
regularly throughout history. Major pandemics and epidemics such as plague, cholera,
ﬂu, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have already afﬂicted humanity. The
world is now facing the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
Many infectious diseases leading to pandemics are caused by zoonotic pathogens
that were transmitted to humans due to increased contacts with animals through
breeding, hunting and global trade activities. The understanding of the mechanisms of
transmission of pathogens to humans allowed the establishment of methods to prevent
and control infections. During centuries, implementation of public health measures such
as isolation, quarantine and border control helped to contain the spread of infectious
diseases and maintain the structure of the society. In the absence of pharmaceutical
interventions, these containment methods have still been used nowadays to control
COVID-19 pandemic. Global surveillance programs of water-borne pathogens, vector-
borne diseases and zoonotic spillovers at the animal-human interface are of prime
importance to rapidly detect the emergence of infectious threats. Novel technologies
for rapid diagnostic testing, contact tracing, drug repurposing, biomarkers of disease
severity as well as new platforms for the development and production of vaccines are
needed for an effective response in case of pandemics.

INTRODUCTION
The shift from hunter-gatherers to agrarian societies has favored the spread of infectious diseases
in the human population (Dobson and Carper, 1996). Expanded trades between communities
have increased interactions between humans and animals and facilitated the transmission of
zoonotic pathogens. Thereafter, expanded cities, extended trade territories, increased travels as
well as eﬀects on ecosystems due to increased human population raised the emergence and
spread of infectious diseases leading to higher risks for outbreaks, epidemics and even pandemics
(Lindahl and Grace, 2015).
The terms endemic, outbreak, epidemic and pandemic relate to the occurrence of a health
condition compared to its predicted rate as well as to its spread in geographic areas (Grennan, 2019).
An endemic condition occurs at a predictable rate among a population. An outbreak corresponds
to an unpredicted increase in the number of people presenting a health condition or in the
occurrence of cases in a new area. An epidemic is an outbreak that spreads to larger geographic
areas. A pandemic is an epidemic that spreads globally.

Piret and Boivin
History of Pandemics
An emerging infection newly appears in a population or is
spread in a new geographic area (Morens et al., 2004). The
zoonotic transmission of pathogens from animals to humans is
a pivotal mechanism by which emerging infections have aﬄicted
humans throughout history (Wolfe et al., 2007). The probability
of cross-species transmission of pathogens was dramatically
enhanced with increased interactions with animals through
hunting, animal farming, trade of animal-based foods, wet
markets or exotic pet trade (Bengis et al., 2004). The process
of cross-species transmission of pathogens involves 5 diﬀerent
stages (Wolfe et al., 2007). (1) the pathogen exclusively infects
animals under natural conditions; (2) the pathogen evolves so
that it can be transmitted to humans but without sustained
human-to-human transmission; (3) the pathogen undergoes only
a few cycles of secondary transmission between humans; (4)
the disease exists in animals but long sequences of secondary
human-to-human transmission occur without the involvement
of animal hosts; and (5) the disease occurs exclusively in humans.
The animal species that harbor the pathogen, the nature of
human interaction with that animal and the frequency of these
interactions likely modulate the risk of zoonotic transmission.
Furthermore, land use and climate changes are suggested to play
important roles in the transmission of pathogens from wildlife to
humans (El-Sayed and Kamel, 2020; White and Razgour, 2020).
There is thus a need to implement surveillance programs to
rapidly detect the emergence of pathogens with a potential for
zoonotic transmission at the animal-human interface.
Climate changes also inﬂuence the transmission of pathogens
(e.g., Dengue, Chikungunya, Zika, Japanese encephalitis, West
Nile viruses, Borrelia burgdorferi) by expanding the habitats
of various common zoonotic disease-carrying vectors (e.g.,
Aedes albopictus mosquitos, ticks) (Caminade et al., 2019). The
emergence of vector-borne pathogens in non-endemic regions
often results in explosive epidemics. Land use due to increasing
human population also aﬀects the distribution of disease-carrying
vectors (Kilpatrick and Randolph, 2012). Control of vector-borne
zoonotic pathogens usually requires vector control to reverse the
drivers of transmission.
Furthermore, the spread of several infectious diseases (e.g.,
tuberculosis, malaria, cholera) to extended geographic areas are
now raising health concerns for a signiﬁcant proportion of the
population (Morens et al., 2004). These diseases show a wider
spread as a result of the acquisition of drug resistance, tolerance
of mosquito vector to insecticides, poor sanitation, land use and
climate changes as well as increased in human mobility and
travels (Cutler et al., 2010). Furthermore, outbreaks of cholera
in regions where natural disasters occurred such as earthquakes
and ﬂoods were also reported. Surveillance programs should be
also implemented to control the spread of these pathogens from
endemic to non-endemic regions.
Finally, infectious agents (e.g., Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia
pestis, variola virus) could be used as bioweapons and could
thus constitute threats for humanity (Oliveira et al., 2020).
These weapons are based on natural microorganisms or
microorganisms that are engineered to be more virulent, highly
transmissible or resistant to therapy (Narayanan et al., 2018). The
release of these biological weapons is intended to induce diseases
in humans or even death. Therefore, governments should
establish biowarfare, bioterrorism and biocrime preparedness
plans to protect the population.
In this paper, we review major pandemics that have aﬄicted
humankind throughout history such as plague, cholera, inﬂuenza
and coronavirus diseases, the way they were controlled in the
past and how these diseases are managed today. Infectious
diseases still represent threats for human health as pathogens
can spread rapidly through global trade and travels. Global
surveillance programs are thus needed to detect and identify
pathogens spillover from animals to humans as well as to control
water-borne pathogens and vector-borne diseases. Furthermore,
eﬀective non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical measures for
the prevention and control of these infections are required to
limit their dissemination in the human population.
PLAGUE
Plague is caused by the ﬂea-borne bacteria Yersinia pestis that is
responsible of at least three human plague pandemics, the plague
of Justinian, the Black Death and the third plague (Table 1)

History of Pandemics
(Zietz and Dunkelberg, 2004). Y. pestis is a gram-negative, rod-
shaped, coccobacillus bacteria. Y. pestis is a facultative anaerobic
bacteria that is transmitted by ﬂeas associated mainly to rodents
and other mammalian hosts (Perry and Fetherston, 1997). Fleas
acquire the bacteria by sucking blood from an infected rodent.
Bacteria quickly multiply and block the alimentary canal in the
gut of the ﬂeas (Bacot and Martin, 1914). The ﬂeas transmit
the bacteria to new rodent hosts by regurgitating the clotted
blood. Plague manifests in three forms, i.e., bubonic, septicemic
and pneumonic, depending on the route of infection (Yang,
2018). The bubonic form is the most common and results
from the bite of an infected ﬂea. Clinical manifestations include
ﬂu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, headache, body pains,
weakness, vomiting and nausea followed by painful swollen
lymph nodes. The bubonic form is likely to be fatal (50–90%
of cases). Septicemic plague is rare (10–25% of cases) and
consists of a progressive bloodstream infection in the absence
of lymphadenopathy. The mortality rate is higher in patients
with septicemic plague than in those with the bubonic form.
Pneumonic plague occurs when the bacteria infects the lungs,
either primarily by infectious respiratory droplets or secondarily
as a complication of bubonic plague. This form is characterized
by a fulminating onset and is rapidly fatal when left untreated.
The Three Pandemics of Plague
The plague of Justinian occurred in Egypt and spread throughout
the Eastern Roman Empire and its neighbors (Table 1) (Cunha
and Cunha, 2008). Between 541 and 543, the plague killed an
estimated 100 million people in the Roman Empire and especially
in its capital, Constantinople. The highly developed structure of
the Roman Empire facilitated the spread of the Justinian plague
along its trade and military routes. In contrast, the plague did
not aﬀect the less organized barbarian societies outside of Rome’s
borders. The high mortality caused by the disease might have
contributed to the weakening and eventually to the decline of
the Byzantine Empire. After this initial pandemic, intermittent
plague outbreaks occurred every 8 to 12 years for two centuries
and then disappeared for unknown reasons.
The identiﬁcation of the causative pathogen involved in the
death of victims of past pandemics usually relies on ancient
DNA techniques aimed to directly extract DNA from skeletal
remains. A great advance in paleomicrobiology techniques was
the isolation of microbial DNA in dental pulp specimens
(Drancourt et al., 1998). Indeed, bacteria are trapped in the dental
pulp early in the course of a bacteremia and can be isolated from
preserved teeth of victims. Therefore, analysis of the dental pulp
is more eﬃcient than bones to accurately identify microbial DNA
from rapidly fatal infections that occurred in the past. Corpses of
victims of the Justinian plague could be recovered in burial sites.
Ancient DNA techniques from dental pulp samples identiﬁed
Y. pestis as the etiological pathogen responsible for this pandemic
(Harbeck et al., 2013).
The second plague pandemic, the Black Death, originated in
East Asia and swept across Central Asia into Europe through
the land and sea trade routes of the medieval Silk Road (Zietz
and Dunkelberg, 2004). The second plague pandemic lasted
in Europe until the early of the 19th century and killed 200
million people. The lineages of Y. pestis that caused the plague
of Justinian and the Black Death were independent emergences
into human population (Wagner et al., 2014). The Black Death
(1347–1351) killed as many as 30% of the European population
and was followed by successive waves such as the plague of Milan
(1630), the great plague of London (1665–1666) and the plague
of Marseille (1720–1722). It is suggested that the bacteria may
have persisted in rodent reservoirs in Europe and periodically
re-emerged in the human population (Seifert et al., 2016).
Another hypothesis could be that climate-driven outbreaks of
Y. pestis in Asian rodent reservoirs were responsible for new
waves of plague arriving into Europe through its maritime trade
network with Asia (Schmid et al., 2015). The bacteria suddenly
disappeared from Europe and this could be possibly related to
the extinction of local rodent reservoirs (Spyrou et al., 2016).
At that time, there was no eﬀective treatment against plague.
Initial institutional responses to disease control began during the
Black Death (Tognotti, 2013). A sanitary cordon was imposed
by armed guards along transit routes and at access points to
cities. A separation between healthy and infected persons was
accomplished in camps and then in permanent plague hospitals
(called lazarettos). Port cities were closed to ships arriving from
plague-infected areas. Ships with suspicion of plague were put in
quarantine, passengers and crew were isolated in lazarettos and
vessels were thoroughly fumigated and retained for 40 days. The
Black Death decimated Medieval Europe and had major impacts
on its socio-economic development, culture, art, religion and
politics (Bramanti et al., 2016).
Based on genomic analysis of ancient and recent genomes,
it was suggested that a wave of plague may have traveled from
Europe to Asia after the Black Death, eventually setting in China
and giving rise to the third plague pandemic (Spyrou et al.,
2016). The latter plague pandemic originated in the middle of
the 19th century in the Yunnan region (China), reached Canton
and spread to Hong Kong (Zietz and Dunkelberg, 2004). In 1894,
Alexandre Yersin discovered the bacteria, Y. pestis, in specimens
of plague patients and dead rats in Hong Kong (Yersin, 1894).
The pandemic then reached Japan, Singapore, Taiwan and India
via ships. Over the following years, plague became endemic in
many countries around the world (Stenseth et al., 2008).
The Plague Nowadays
Since the 1990’s, plague is classiﬁed as a re-emerging infectious
disease by the World Health Organization (WHO) (World
Health Organization [WHO], 2017a). Between 2010 and 2015,
the number of plague cases was estimated at 3,248 with 584
fatalities worldwide, most of them occurring in Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Peru (Glatter and
Finkelman, 2020). In September 2017, a large outbreak of plague
occurred in Madagascar with 2,417 cases among whom 77%
were clinically suspected to have the pneumonic form (Mead,
2018). The basic reproduction number (Ro) was estimated at
1.73 (Tsuzuki et al., 2017). The case fatality rate was as high as
8.6% (Mead, 2018). Plague is seasonal in most endemic countries
with a well-deﬁned geographic distribution which corresponds
to those of the vectors and rodent reservoirs (Prentice and
Rahalison, 2007). Nowadays, plague should be considered as a

History of Pandemics
neglected human threat due to its rapid spread, its high fatality
rate without early treatment and its capacity to disrupt social
and healthcare systems (Valles et al., 2020). The genetic plasticity
of Y. pestis also suggests a potential risk for the emergence
of antibiotic resistance (Radnedge et al., 2002). Surveillance
and control programs of ﬂeas and animals involved in the life
cycle of Y. pestis are required in endemic regions. Individuals
should protect themselves against ﬂea bites in regions where
plague is present. It is also recommended to avoid contact with
infected body ﬂuids and tissues as well as animal carcasses.
Public health interventions that can be put in place to prevent
or limit plague outbreaks include the killing of ﬂeas with
insecticides and, if required, the control of infected rodents; the
early isolation of patients, the rapid diagnostic and treatment of
infected individuals with antibiotics; the detection and isolation
of contacts and the administration of chemoprophylaxis to
exposed individuals (Prentice and Rahalison, 2007). Standard
treatments against plague include streptomycin and doxycycline.
Alternative drugs consist of gentamicin and ﬂuoroquinolones
(Butler, 2014; Yang, 2018). The WHO does not recommend
vaccination except for health care workers and laboratory
personnel who are highly exposed to the pathogen. Fifty years
ago, a plague vaccine based on whole Y. pestis killed with formalin
was approved in the United States. This vaccine was eﬀective
against bubonic plague but not against the pneumonic form
of the disease. Furthermore, this vaccine was associated with a
high reactogenicity. As highlighted in the Madagascar outbreak,
Y. pestis can be responsible for pneumonic plague in a high
number of cases. Furthermore, Y. pestis can be aerosolized for use
as a bioweapon. Y. pestis is considered as a category A pathogen
as it can be easily disseminated or transmitted from person
to person, cause high mortality rates and have the potential
for major public health impact (Ansari et al., 2020). Therefore,
the development of a plague vaccine against the most deadly
form of the disease is needed. In 2017, the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) granted Orphan Drug designation to the
recombinant F1 and V subunits vaccine (rF1V) that is intended as
a prophylactic vaccine for individuals at high-risk of exposure to
aerosolized Y. pestis. Several prophylactic and therapeutic plague
vaccines are also being developed under the Plague Vaccine
Target Product Proﬁle (TPP) established by the WHO in 2018
(World Health Organization [WHO], 2018a). Vaccines under
development include subunit, bacterial vector-based or viral
vector-based vaccines expressing one or several antigens [F1
capsular protein, low calcium response protein V (LcrV), YscF
and/or pesticin coagulase] of Y. pestis (Sun and Singh, 2019).
CHOLERA
Cholera is an acute often fatal disease of the gastrointestinal
tract caused by Vibrio cholerae (Faruque et al., 1998). V. cholerae
is a gram-negative and coma-shaped bacteria. V. cholerae is
a facultative anaerobe and has a ﬂagellum at one cell pole
as well as pili. The bacteria colonizes the small intestine and
produces the cholera toxin which is responsible for a rapid and
massive loss of body ﬂuids leading to dehydration, hypovolemic
shock and death. V. cholerae strains are classiﬁed based on their
major lipopolysaccharide O antigens into approximately 206
serogroups of which serogroups O1 (consisting of two biotypes
known as classical and El Tor) and O139 cause epidemic cholera
(Chatterjee and Chaudhuri, 2006). V. cholerae is a water-borne
pathogen. Humans are infected through contaminated water
used for drinking or preparing foods. The infection is often
mild or asymptomatic and bacteria are eliminated with feces
in 1 or 2 weeks. V. cholerae persists indeﬁnitely in aquatic
reservoirs and may acquire mobile elements via horizontal gene
transfer leading to the emergence of new toxigenic clones (Cho
et al., 2010). V. cholerae are able to form a three-dimensional
bioﬁlm where the organisms can survive during inter-epidemic
periods (Alam et al., 2007). Optimal growth conditions of
bacteria in aquatic reservoirs include 15% salinity, 30◦C water
temperature and pH 8.5 that can be promoted by climate changes
(Montilla et al., 1996).
The Seven Cholera Pandemics
Cholera was endemic in Asia until 1817, when a ﬁrst pandemic
spread from India to several other regions of the world (Table 1)
(Faruque et al., 1998). This pandemic emerged during a period
of increasing globalization resulting from technological progress
in transportation. Indeed, the advent of steamships and railways
allowed a dramatic decrease in travel time and a rise in trade.
At that time, health prevention strategies were essentially the
same than those implemented during the Black Death (Tognotti,
2013). Infected persons were isolated in lazarettos. Port entry
was forbidden for ships arriving from regions where cholera
was present. Travelers who had contacts with infected persons
or who came from a place where cholera was circulating
were quarantined.
Thereafter, ﬁve additional major pandemics of cholera that
originated from India and spread to other continents occurred
during the 19th and 20th centuries (Table 1) (Faruque et al.,
1998). The second and sixth pandemics, and presumably the
other ones, were caused by the O1 classical biotype of V. cholerae
(Devault et al., 2014; Siddique and Cash, 2014). The second
pandemic of cholera reached the British islands. During the
cholera outbreak in Soho (London), in 1854, the physician John
Snow used for the ﬁrst time epidemiological methods to trace
the source of the outbreak. He described the time course of the
outbreak and its geographical spread in the city. He identiﬁed
the public pumps used for water supply in these areas and
understood that water was the source of the contamination. He
then proposed eﬀective measures to prevent the transmission
through the removal of pump handle in the city areas where
the outbreak occurred (Smith, 2002). The bacillus of cholera
was isolated during the ﬁfth pandemic that extensively aﬀected
South America by Robert Koch (1884) who also understood the
importance of clean water in preventing its transmission. The
toxin responsible for the disease was only discovered in 1959 (De,
1959). The seventh cholera pandemic is the most extensive in
terms of geographic spread and duration (Mutreja et al., 2011;
Hu et al., 2016). It began in Indonesia in 1961 and became
endemic in many regions of the world. It periodically caused
major epidemics such as those in Zimbabwe (2008), Haiti (2010),

History of Pandemics
Sierra Leone (2012), Mexico (2013), South Soudan and Ghana
(2014) and Yemen (2016). Cholera epidemics usually ended
because of a lack of favorable environmental conditions for the
survival of vibrios. The seventh cholera pandemic was caused
by El Tor biotype strain of V. cholerae that acquired virulence
genes in the environment (Safa et al., 2010). In late 1992, the
O139 serogroup caused a large cholera outbreak in Bangladesh
and neighboring countries and raised the fear of a 8th cholera
pandemic (Albert et al., 1993).
Cholera Nowadays
Cholera cannot be eradicated as it is a natural inhabitant of
aquatic ecosystems. V. cholerae serogroups O1 and O139 are
responsible for cholera outbreaks in developing countries. In
2019, 923,037 cases and 1,911 deaths were reported to WHO
in 31 countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020d).
However, it is estimated that the global burden of cholera is
higher due to underreporting. Between 2008 and 2012, the
number of cases was shown to range between 1.3 and 4 millions
per year with 95,000 deaths (Ali et al., 2015). Environmental and
climate changes may increase the geographical distribution of
cholera (Chowdhury et al., 2017). Furthermore, the emergence
of environmental non-O1/O139 V. cholerae is increasing as
genetic exchange mechanisms such as horizontal gene transfer
and genetic recombination are favored by changes in ecosystem
and climate (Vezzulli et al., 2020). These non-O1/O139 vibrios
can cause illness that can be mild (e.g., gastroenteritis, otitis) to
life-threatening (necrotizing fasciitis) and could thus constitute a
potential threat for humans. The persistence of cholera is related
to poor living conditions including shortage of safe drinking
water, insuﬃcient sanitation, crowded housing and the lack
of eﬃcient sewage systems. Re-emergence of the disease can
also occur following natural disasters such as earthquakes that
disrupt access to safe water supply. Cholera outbreaks could
be predicted based on real-time monitoring of oceanic regions,
climate ﬂuctuations and epidemiological surveillance program
(Chowdhury et al., 2017). The disease could be prevented by
implementation of public health measures to ensure adequate
sanitation and safe water supply (Somboonwit et al., 2017).
The access to safe drinking water and sanitation are among
the primary priorities of the Millenium Development Goals
and the sustainable Development Goals (Igere and Ekundayo,
2020). Furthermore, the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH)
program launched by the WHO is central to the prevention of
cholera transmission (Wolfe et al., 2018). Currently, three oral
cholera vaccines were pre-qualiﬁed by the WHO (Dukoral
R⃝,
SancholTM and Euvochol-Plus
R⃝). These vaccines should be
used in areas with endemic cholera, cholera outbreaks and
humanitarian crisis with high-risk of cholera in combination
with other cholera prevention and control measures (World
Health Organization [WHO], 2019). Cholera is ﬁrst identiﬁed
based on clinical symptoms of severe acute watery diarrhea. The
disease is then conﬁrmed by the detection of V. cholerae in
stool samples by culture, molecular testing or rapid diagnostic
tests. The majority of infected individuals can be treated by
the administration of prompt oral rehydration solution. Severely
dehydrated patients who are at risk of shock require rapid
administration of intravenous ﬂuids as well as antibiotics.
First-line drug consists of doxycycline whereas alternative
treatments include tetracycline, ciproﬂoxacin and azithromycin
(Hsueh and Waters, 2019).
INFLUENZA
Inﬂuenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family.
Inﬂuenza viruses are enveloped, negative-sense, single-stranded
RNA viruses (Wright and Webster, 2001). Their genome
consists of 7 or 8 RNA segments encoding at least 10
structural and non-structural proteins. Structural proteins
include a hemagglutinin (HA), a neuraminidase (NA), two
matrix proteins and a nucleoprotein. Inﬂuenza viruses can
be distinguished in types A, B, C, and D. Inﬂuenza A
and B are responsible for outbreaks in tropical regions and
seasonal epidemics in temperate regions whereas inﬂuenza
A viruses are the only ones with a pandemic potential
(Lofgren et al., 2007). Indeed, inﬂuenza A virus is endemic
in a number of species including humans, birds and pigs
(Webster et al., 1992). Gene reassortments can thus occur
between human and animal inﬂuenza A viruses and lead to
a new virus subtype which can be pathogenic to humans
(Webster et al., 1995).
In a typical seasonal epidemics, inﬂuenza virus causes 3 to
5 million cases of severe illness and approximately 500,000
deaths worldwide (Iuliano et al., 2018). Most typical seasonal
inﬂuenza infections are asymptomatic or cause only mild
or classical inﬂuenza illness characterized by 4 or 5 days
of fever, cough, chills, headache, muscle pain, weakness and
sometimes upper respiratory tract symptoms (Zambon, 2001).
Severe complications can occur especially in infants, elderly
and individuals with chronic conditions such as diabetes
mellitus and cardiac/pulmonary diseases. Among the most severe
complications is pneumonia which can be associated with
secondary bacterial infection.
Annual inﬂuenza epidemics are sustained in the human
population through mutations occurring especially in the HA
and NA viral surface glycoproteins, the major targets for
neutralizing antibodies. Seasonal inﬂuenza virus results from
frequent antigenic drifts every 2–5 years in response to selection
pressure to evade human immunity (Kim et al., 2018). Its genome
contains segmented genes which may undergo reassortments
in cells co-infected with two or more inﬂuenza viruses. Each
inﬂuenza A virus has a gene encoding for 1 of 16 possible
HAs and another gene encoding for 1 of 9 possible NAs
that are involved in viral attachment and release, respectively
(Dugan et al., 2008). Of the 144 total combinatorial possibilities,
only 3 HAs and 3 NAs in only 4 combinations (A/H1N1,
A/H2N2, A/H3N2 and possibly A/H3N8) were found to be
truly adapted to humans. Rarely, antigenic shift which results
from reassortment between human and animal viruses leads to
the emergence of a new virus subtype (Webster et al., 1995;
Ma et al., 2009). This antigenically distinct virus may have
the ability to infect humans and achieve sustained human-
to-human transmission and may cause a pandemic if the

History of Pandemics
immunity in the human population is partial or lacking
(Webster et al., 1992).
Inﬂuenza Pandemics
The time in which inﬂuenza virus began to infect humans
or cause a pandemic cannot be determined with accuracy but
many historians agree that the ﬁrst inﬂuenza pandemic could
have likely occurred in 1510 (Morens et al., 2010). The Russian
ﬂu that occurred between 1889 and 1893 was the ﬁrst well-
described pandemic (Taubenberger et al., 2007). This pandemic
was possibly caused by an A/H3N8 virus based on serologic
and epidemiologic data (Worobey et al., 2014). The virus spread
rapidly as it took only 4 months to circumvent the planet
(Valleron et al., 2010). The pandemic virus reappeared every
year for 3 years and caused an estimated 1 million deaths
worldwide (Table 1). The median Ro was estimated at 2.1
(interquartile range 1.9–2.4) (Valleron et al., 2010). The case
fatality rates ranged from 0.10 to 0.28% so the mortality burden
of this pandemic was considered as low (Valleron et al., 2010).
The median clinical attack rate was 60% (interquartile range
45–70%) (Valleron et al., 2010). Attack rates were highest in
individuals aged 1–60 years and lower in infants and seniors
(Valtat et al., 2011). In contrast, mortality rate showed a J-shape
curve with highest rates in infants and people over 20 years of age
(Valtat et al., 2011).
Twenty ﬁve years later, the Spanish ﬂu was caused by
an A/H1N1 virus (Table 1) that apparently arose by genetic
adaptation of an existing avian inﬂuenza virus to a new human
host (Reid et al., 2004). Before its identiﬁcation, the virus
spread silently around the world and its region of origin could
not be determined. Analysis of formalin-ﬁxed and paraﬃn-
embedded samples as well as permafrost-frozen corpses from
that time conﬁrmed that the strain was an A/H1N1 inﬂuenza
virus (Reid et al., 1999). Typical attack rates were 25–33% and
the Ro was estimated at 2–3 (Mills et al., 2004). The 1918–1919
pandemic spread in at least 3 distinct waves within a 9 month
interval. The ﬁrst wave occurred during spring-summer 1918 and
caused high morbidity and low mortality. Both the second and
third waves in summer-fall 1918 and winter 1918–1919 caused
high mortality. The 1918–1919 inﬂuenza pandemic resulted in
approximately 500 million infections and 50 million deaths
worldwide (Johnson and Mueller, 2002). Fatality of epidemic
inﬂuenza usually follows a characteristic U-shape curve with
high mortality rates in the very young (< 5 years) and the
elderly (> 65 years). However, the 1918–1919 pandemic showed
a W-shaped mortality curve with high case fatality rates in
the very young and the elderly as well as in healthy young
adults aged 20–40 years (Morens and Taubenberger, 2018). This
uncommon age distribution suggests that the severity of the
1918–1919 inﬂuenza pandemic was not primarily due to a hyper-
virulent strain but was more likely related to host factors that
prevent individuals to control the infection. It is suggested that
an A/H3N8 virus was circulating between 1890 and 1900 and
that individuals born at this time may have lacked immunity
against the antigenically distinct 1918 A/H1N1 virus (Worobey
et al., 2014). The most common clinical manifestation was an
acute aggressive bronchopneumonia presenting with epithelial
necrosis, microvasculitis/vascular necrosis, hemorrhages, edema
and severe tissue damage to the lungs (Morens and Fauci, 2007)
often followed by secondary bacteria invasion with Streptococcus
pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and
Haemophilus inﬂuenzae (Morens et al., 2008). It is suggested that
the 1918 inﬂuenza virus had an enhanced capacity to spread
to and damage bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells that
could allow bacteria to breach the mucociliary barrier leading
to fatal bacterial pneumonia (Morens and Fauci, 2007). The
second common clinical manifestation was an acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with severe facial cyanosis
that was observed in 10–15% of cases (Shanks, 2015). The H1
hemagglutinin of the 1918–1919 pandemic virus was identiﬁed
as a key virulence factor for mammalian and was associated with
increased respiratory epithelial pathogenicity and elicitation of a
strong pro-inﬂammatory response (Qi et al., 2014). Most deaths
occurred from several days to weeks (median 7–10 days) after
the onset of symptoms (Shanks and Brundage, 2012). In large
cities of Western world, health authorities implemented a series
of containment strategies to prevent the spread of the disease
including the closure of schools, churches and theaters and
the suspension of public gatherings. Physicians encouraged the
practice of individual measures such as respiratory hygiene and
social distancing. However, these measures were implemented
too late and in an uncoordinated manner due to World War I.
Travel restrictions and border controls were impossible to put
in place. The movement of military troops and the poor living
conditions of soldiers in the trench warfare in Europe facilitated
the spread of the disease.
Over the past century, descendants of the 1918 pandemic
virus were the cause of almost all seasonal inﬂuenza A epidemics
worldwide. All inﬂuenza A viruses responsible for the 1957,
1968 and 2009 pandemics (Table 1) also derived from the
founding 1918 virus by gene reassortments between human,
avian and swine inﬂuenza viruses (Morens et al., 2009) as shown
in Figure 1.
The new subtype A/H2N2 that caused the 1957–1959
pandemic (Asian ﬂu) derived from the 1918 virus by acquisition
of 3 new avian gene segments (HA, NA and PB1 polymerase)
by reassortment (Kawaoka et al., 1989) whereas the circulating
A/H1N1 was totally replaced. Sustained transmission of the
1957–1959 pandemic virus started on December 1957 with
recurrent waves occurring over several years (Housworth and
Langmuir, 1974). The morbidity was highest in children and
the mortality was highest at the extremes of age. The case
fatality rate was approximately 0.13% (Mc, 1958). The global
mortality of the 1957–1959 inﬂuenza pandemic was estimated at
1–2 millions based on excess death due to respiratory diseases
(Viboud et al., 2016). The Ro was estimated at 1.65 (interquartile
range 1.53–1.70) (Biggerstaﬀ et al., 2014). The highest attack
rates were in school-age children through young adults up
to 35 or 40 years of age (Serﬂing et al., 1967). Older adults,
including those over the age of 60, had signiﬁcantly lower attack
rates. This unusual distribution was attributed to the absence
of protective antibody among children and middle-aged adults.
Histopathological studies from autopsies were characterized by a
rapid development of bronchial epithelial necrosis, preservation

History of Pandemics
FIGURE 1 | Timeline of inﬂuenza pandemics caused by the 1918 H1N1 virus and its descendants produced by reassortment of circulating strains with avian
inﬂuenza viruses (AIV) and swine H1N1 viruses. The reassortment of genes is shown in parenthesis. The re-emergence of H1N1 virus in 1977 is also shown as it
co-circulated with the H3N2 virus before being replaced by the H1N1pdm09. HA, hemagglutinin; NA, neuraminidase; NP, nucleoprotein; M, matrix proteins, PB1

of the basal layer, limited inﬂammatory response and evidence
of prompt repair (Walsh et al., 1961). Secondary bacterial
pneumonia was a relatively minor cause of fatalities possibly as
a result of the widespread use of antibiotics (Robertson et al.,
1958; Oseasohn et al., 1959). The proportion of strains resistant
to antibiotics was relatively high in fatal cases compared to those
isolated from cases who recovered. Furthermore, mechanical
ventilators were available in the intensive care units (ICU) to
support cases presenting hypoxemia. At that time, the pathogenic
agent had been identiﬁed (Smith and Andrewes, 1933) and
knowledge on the pathogenesis of the disease had advanced. In
1952, the WHO had implemented a global inﬂuenza surveillance
network that provided information on the emergence and spread
of the novel inﬂuenza virus. Containment measures (such as
closure of schools and nursery, bans on public gatherings) varied
from country to country but delayed the onset of the disease for
a few weeks only. Inﬂuenza vaccination (vaccine eﬃcacy of 53–
60%) failed to have a signiﬁcant impact on the pandemic due to
inadequate coverage (Henderson et al., 2009).
The 1968–1970 pandemic virus emerged when 2 gene
segments encoding for HA and PB1 polymerase moved from an
avian virus in the A/H2N2 virus through genetic reassortment
whereas the NA remained unchanged (Kawaoka et al., 1989).
The new A/H3N2 reassortant replaced the A/H2N2 virus that
circulated in the human population since 1957. The global
mortality rate of the 1968–1970 pandemic (Hong Kong ﬂu) was
estimated to be 0.5–2 millions (Saunders-Hastings and Krewski,
2016). The Ro was estimated at 1.80 (interquartile range 1.56–
1.85) (Biggerstaﬀ et al., 2014). The mean age at death was 62–
65 years. The ﬁrst pandemic season was more severe than the
second one in North America whereas the opposite was seen in
Europe and Asia (Viboud et al., 2005). The 1968–1970 inﬂuenza
pandemic was mild in all countries and comparable to severe
seasonal epidemics. The mildness of this pandemic is expected
considering pre-existing immunity to the NA antigen in all age
groups and to the HA in the elderly. No speciﬁc containment
measures were implemented during this pandemic. In 1977,
a descendant of the 1918 A/H1N1 re-emerged suspiciously in
Russia and co-circulated with the reassortant A/H3N2 virus
thereafter (Gregg et al., 1978).
The 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic was a triple reassortant
made of inﬂuenza genes originating from human A/H3N2
(PB1 polymerase gene segment), avian (PB2 polymerase and
PA polymerase gene segments) and North American (H1,
nucleoprotein and Non-structural proteins gene segments) and
Eurasian (N1 and matrix proteins gene segments) swine that
was transmitted from pigs to humans (Easterbrook et al., 2011).
The 2009 H1 protein had minimal antigenic drift compared
to its 1918 counterpart. Due to its pathogenicity in humans,
it is suggested that the maintenance of H1 immunity in the
population may be important to prevent future pandemics
(Morens and Taubenberger, 2018). The 2009 inﬂuenza virus
emerged in Mexico and almost simultaneous outbreaks began in
Mexico and in Southern United States (Neumann and Kawaoka,
2011). The virus then spread globally over the next 6 weeks.
The A/H1N1pdm09 virus was associated with a lower attack
rate in older individuals possibly because of previous exposition
to older A/H1N1 viruses. Clinical symptoms associated to
the A/H1N1pdm09 range from mild respiratory irritations to
severe pneumonia associated to ARDS when infection progressed
(Chowell et al., 2009). Asymptomatic infections accounted for
approximately 10% of cases (Papenburg et al., 2010). Severe
disease developed in a small proportion of healthy adults, many of
whom had no underlying conditions (Viboud et al., 2010). The Ro
was estimated at 1.46 (interquartile 1.30–1.70) (Biggerstaﬀ et al.,
2014). The WHO reported 18,631 laboratory-conﬁrmed deaths.
However, the mortality burden was estimated to be between
148,000 and 249,000 based on excess death due to respiratory

History of Pandemics
diseases in several countries (Simonsen et al., 2013). The case
fatality rate based on conﬁrmed cases was 0.5% (Nishiura, 2010).
Later studies estimated the symptomatic case fatality rate at
0.05% of all medically attended symptomatic cases. Mortality
rates in younger populations aﬀecting children, young adults and
pregnant women were higher than in a typical inﬂuenza season.
The average age of people who died with laboratory-conﬁrmed
inﬂuenza was 37 years (Vaillant et al., 2009). Non-pharmaceutical
interventions that were implemented included hand washing, use
of face masks and cough etiquette (Cantey et al., 2013). The 2009
pandemic was the ﬁrst one to combine vaccines and antiviral use.
Symptomatic individuals and their contacts were isolated and
received antiviral treatment as prophylaxis. Although the vaccine
was approved only during the second wave, the immunization
program in Canada covered 33 to 50% of its population compared
to 13 to 39% in United States (Gilmour and Hofmann, 2010).
The new pandemic virus completely replaced the prior circulating
seasonal A/H1N1 whereas the inﬂuenza A/H3N2 continued to
circulate.
Overall, the impacts of an inﬂuenza pandemic depend on
the transmissibility and virulence of the strain and on the
susceptibility of the population, which may vary according to age
and past exposure to inﬂuenza viruses. The impacts of inﬂuenza
are not always higher during pandemics than during seasonal
epidemic periods. However, a shift in the age distribution
of mortality toward younger age groups distinguishes the
impacts of a pandemic from those of seasonal epidemics
(Simonsen et al., 1998).
Avian Inﬂuenza and the Risks for a New
Pandemic
The constant adaptation and exchange of genes between
inﬂuenza viruses in diﬀerent species, including at the animal-
human interface, is still a critical challenge for the emergence
of pandemic viruses nowadays. In this respect, a series of avian
inﬂuenza A viruses have caused sporadic cases and outbreaks
of severe diseases and deaths in humans (Li et al., 2019).
These viruses are divided into two groups, low pathogenic avian
inﬂuenza (LPAI) and highly pathogenic avian inﬂuenza (HPAI)
viruses, based on their virulence in chicken. The ﬁrst human
outbreak due to a HPAI was caused by an A/H5N1 virus in 1997
in Hong Kong where 18 positive cases associated with 6 deaths
were reported (Chan, 2002). This A/H5N1 HPAI virus continues
to spread in poultry and in a large number of wild bird species
on several continents. This virus caused severe and fatal spillover
infections in humans and rarely resulted in human-to-human
transmission (Ungchusak et al., 2005). This virus was eventually
detected in 17 countries and led to 861 human cases with a
case fatality rate of 53% as of October 23, 2020 (World Health
Organization [WHO], 2020b). The A/H5N1 virus has thus a
potential for high morbidity and mortality in humans but it seems
unlikely that it could become adapted with eﬃcient human-to-
human transmission (Morens and Taubenberger, 2015). A LPAI
A/H7N9 virus emerged in China in 2013 (Gao et al., 2013).
This virus was then shown to evolve to highly pathogenic strains
in late 2016 (Kile et al., 2017). Infection with A/H7N9 has
been reported in 1,567 human cases with a fatality rate of 39%
as of September 5, 2018 (World Health Organization [WHO],
2018b). To date, sporadic familial clusters of A/H7N9 have been
reported but there is still no evidence of sustained human-to-
human transmission of the virus (Wu et al., 2020). Sporadic cases
of human infections with avian inﬂuenza viruses also occurred
with A/H5N6, A/H6N1, A/H7N2, A/H7N3, A/H7N4, A/H7N7,
A/H9N2, A/H10N7 and A/H10N8 strains (Widdowson et al.,
2017). Surveillance programs for monitoring animal inﬂuenza
viruses with zoonotic potential facilitate the rapid detection
of human threats. However, obvious clinical manifestations of
inﬂuenza infections may be lacking in avian species thereby
complicating early detection and eﬃcient control of potential
outbreaks (Li et al., 2019). Furthermore, the conditions required
for cross-species transmission from avian species to humans
are not yet elucidated and surveillance programs would most
likely require longitudinal surveillance in multiple hosts. Non-
pharmaceutical measures aim to reduce the number of live-
bird markets and to decrease contacts between humans and
birds in breeding facilities have been implemented to prevent
and control zoonotic inﬂuenza virus infections. Animal facilities
must be periodically disinfected and employees exposed to
birds must wear protective personal equipment and be isolated
in case of suspected contamination. Pharmaceutical measures
include the use of vaccines (including poultry vaccination) and
antiviral agents such as the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir,
zanamivir and peramivir) and polymerase inhibitors (baloxavir
marboxil and favipiravir) (Beigel and Hayden, 2020). The WHO
together with reference laboratories determine viral antigenicity
of strains circulating in avian species that could be used in the
development of candidate vaccines for pandemic preparedness.
To date, candidate vaccines are available for H5, H7 and H9
inﬂuenza viruses (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020a).
The development of a universal vaccine to prevent any subtype
of inﬂuenza virus is a priority (Yamayoshi and Kawaoka, 2019).
Finally, it is not excluded that the circulating human A/H3N2
virus could acquire an avian H2 gene by reassortment. As the
majority of the population has no protective immunity against
the H2 subtype that circulated between 1957 and 1968, the
emergence of a H2N2 reassortant could be a potential risk for a
future pandemic (Taubenberger and Morens, 2010).
CORONAVIRUSES
Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family and include
four genera, i.e., alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-coronaviruses
(Masters and Perlman, 2013). Coronaviruses are enveloped,
positive-sense, single-stranded, RNA viruses that infect a wide
range of animals and humans. The genome encodes non-
structural proteins and 4 structural proteins including the
membrane, spike, envelope and nucleocapsid proteins. Human
coronaviruses (HCoVs) cause seasonal respiratory diseases, and
to a lesser extent, gastroenteritis. HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43,
which belong to the alpha-coronavirus genus, are the causative
agents of common cold (Kahn and McIntosh, 2005). HCoV-NL63
and HCoV-HKU1, which are members of the beta-coronavirus

History of Pandemics
genus, cause more severe, although rarely fatal, infections of the
upper and lower respiratory tracts (Kahn and McIntosh, 2005).
Furthermore, beta-coronaviruses also include three highly
pathogenic viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 [the etiological
agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] that induce
severe pneumonia in humans (Table 1) (Song et al., 2019).
SARS-CoV Epidemic
SARS-CoV originated in Guangdong province (China) in 2003.
Bats are likely the possible natural reservoir of SARS-CoV (Li
et al., 2005) and palm civets could be intermediary hosts before
dissemination to humans (Guan et al., 2003). The causative
agent was identiﬁed within a few weeks (Drosten et al., 2003;
Ksiazek et al., 2003). During the 2002–2003 outbreak, SARS-
CoV infection was reported in 29 countries in North America,
South America, Europe and Asia. Overall, 8,437 probable
cases were reported with 813 SARS-related fatalities (World
Health Organization [WHO], 2003). The case fatality rate was
9.7%. Transmission of SARS-CoV was mainly nosocomial with
rates of 33–42% whereas rates of 22–39% occurred between
family members (Chowell et al., 2015). Infection with SARS-
CoV typically caused an inﬂuenza-like syndrome with rigors,
fatigue and high fever. Less common symptoms include nausea,
vomiting and diarrhea. In 20–30% of infected patients, the
disease progressed to an atypical pneumonia, with shortness of
breath and poor oxygen exchange in the alveoli with the patients
requiring management in ICU or mechanical ventilation. Many
of these patients also developed watery diarrhea with active
virus shedding. Respiratory failure was the most common cause
of death among patients infected with SARS-CoV. The major
routes of transmission of SARS-CoV were droplets, aerosols
and fomites (Seto et al., 2003). The Ro of SARS-CoV was
approximately 3 (Petersen et al., 2020). SARS-CoV quickly
became a global threat because of its rapid transmission and
high mortality rate. Protective immunity against this virus as
well as eﬀective antiviral drugs and vaccines were lacking. The
low infectivity and long incubation period (viral load peaks at
6–11 days after symptom onset) of SARS-CoV provided time
for implementing a series of containment measures to prevent
transmission (Weinstein, 2004). Case identiﬁcation and isolation
followed by contact tracing and surveillance proved eﬀective in
containing the global threat and eradicating the virus in almost
7 months. However, some SARS-CoV-like viruses found in bats
have been shown to be able to infect human cells without prior
adaptation, which indicates that SARS could re-emerge in the
future (Ge et al., 2013).
MERS-CoV Epidemic
Ten years after the ﬁrst emergence of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV
was reported in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. The potential animal
reservoirs of MERS-CoV are bats and dromedary camels have
been suggested as the intermediary hosts (Conzade et al., 2018).
Advances in molecular diagnostic tools such as next-generation
sequencing allowed that the etiological agent was identiﬁed
within weeks of global spread (Zaki et al., 2012). Between 2012
and 2020, 2,519 laboratory-conﬁrmed cases of MERS-CoV with
at least 866 deaths were reported in 27 countries (World Health
Organization [WHO], 2020c). All cases have been linked to
persons in the Arabian Peninsula or who had returned from
traveling in MERS-CoV endemic areas. Almost 50% of MERS-
CoV cases were due to nosocomial transmission to inpatients,
health care workers and visitors (Hui et al., 2018). Transmission
between family members has only occurred in 13–21% of cases
(Chowell et al., 2015). Individuals with MERS-CoV present
with a wide range of clinical features from mild to severe
fulminant pulmonary disease (Memish et al., 2020). Those with
severe disease are often older than 65 years with comorbidities
and can develop symptoms at a later time. Asymptomatic to
mild infection rates of 25–50% have been reported. Infection
with MERS-CoV causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia and
renal dysfunction with various clinical symptoms including
fever, chills, rigors, headache, a non-productive cough, sore
throat, arthralgia and myalgia. Other symptoms include nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. It is estimated that 50–
89% of patients with progression to respiratory and/or renal
failure require ICU admission. The high incidence of ARDS
in these patients is reﬂected by a high case fatality rate of
34%. The Ro of MERS-CoV is low (approximately 1) (Petersen
et al., 2020) which allows to control the transmission in the
absence of mitigation strategies, although the virus caused
several nosocomial outbreaks in hospital of Saudi Arabia, Jordan
and South Korea.
MERS-CoV is still circulating nowadays. The ubiquity of
infected dromedary camels close to humans (Kandeil et al.,
2019) and the continuing zoonotic transmission may explain
why MERS-CoV continues to cause intermittent sporadic cases,
community clusters and nosocomial outbreaks (Sikkema et al.,
2019). Furthermore, the outbreak in South Korea highlights the
potential of MERS-CoV to spread around the world and thus
to be a threat for global health (Petersen et al., 2015). There
is currently no licensed vaccine or treatment available against
MERS-CoV infection. The clinical management of patients with
MERS-CoV consists mainly in providing supportive care for
the relief of pain and fever, supporting vital organ functions
and treating concomitant or secondary bacterial infections
with antibiotics (Memish et al., 2020). Critically ill patients
required to be managed in an ICU. The WHO is supporting
molecular and serological surveillance studies at the dromedary-
human interface in several Middle East countries (World
Health Organization [WHO], 2018c). Indeed, recombination
events were reported to occur leading to diﬀerent lineages of
MERS-CoV in dromedary camels (Sabir et al., 2016). New
MERS-CoV variants were also shown to emerge over time
(AlBalwi et al., 2020). Furthermore, this organization has issued
recommendations for not consuming unpasteurized camel milk
and undercooked animal products and to be cautious in cases
of close contacts with dromedary camels. Appropriate hospital
hygiene practices and implementation of contact and droplet
precautions are crucial to limit future nosocomial outbreaks.
The implementation of extensive contact tracing in order to
rapidly diagnose suspected MERS-CoV cases and isolation of
individuals to break the chain of infections in the community
is also essential. The WHO calls for the development of three
types of vaccines against MERS-CoV: a human vaccine that

is intended for long-term protection of individuals at high-
risk of exposure such as health care workers and those having
contacts with potentially infected dromedary camels, a human
vaccine for use during outbreaks and a dromedary camel vaccine
to prevent zoonotic transmission (World Health Organization
[WHO], 2017b). The spike protein of MERS-CoV is an important
target for the development of vaccines (Zhang N. et al., 2020).
These vaccines are based on DNA, viral vectors, viral proteins,
virus-like particles, bacterium-like particles and nanoparticles.
The progression of most of these vaccines from pre-clinical
studies to clinical trials are prevented by lack of funds. Only a
few ones were tested in phase I clinical studies until now.
SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic
In early December 2019, atypical pneumonia were reported
in a cluster of patients in Wuhan (China) and were shown
to be caused by a new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2 (Zhu
et al., 2020) whereas the disease is referred to as COVID-19. The
animal reservoirs are likely bats (Lau et al., 2020). It was proposed
that pangolins could be the animal hosts that transmit the virus
to humans (Lam et al., 2020) but the intermediary host, if any,
has not yet been deﬁnitely identiﬁed. SARS-CoV-2 infection may
be asymptomatic (up to 40% of cases) or causes a wide spectrum
of illness from mild symptoms to life-threatening disease
(Wiersinga et al., 2020). Infected individuals most commonly
present with fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, fatigue,
myalgia, nausea/vomiting or diarrhea, headache, weakness,
rhinorrhea, anosmia and ageusia. Common complications
among hospitalized patients include pneumonia, ARDS, acute
liver injury, cardiac injury, prothrombotic coagulopathy, acute
kidney injury and neurologic manifestations. Critically ill
patients could also develop a cytokine storm and a macrophage
activation syndrome. Comorbidities such as hypertension,
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease,
chronic kidney disease, malignancy and chronic liver disease
have been present in 60–90% of hospitalized patients (Richardson
et al., 2020). Mild symptoms occurred in 80% of laboratory-
conﬁrmed
cases.
Approximately
14–19%
of
patients
are
hospitalized and 3–5% of cases require transfer to ICU, most
commonly due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. Among
them, 29–91% necessitate invasive mechanical ventilation.
Overall, mortality of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is
approximately 15–20% whereas it is as high as 40% in patients
requiring ICU admission. The global estimated case fatality rate
ranges between 0.25 and 3.0% (Wilson N. et al., 2020). Mortality
ranges from 0.02% in patients aged 20–49 years to 0.5% for
patients aged 50–69 years and greater than 5.4% for patients
aged more than 80 years. Children with COVID-19 have milder
symptoms predominantly limited to the upper respiratory tract.
However, a rare multisystem inﬂammatory syndrome has been
described in some children with COVID-19 (Rowley et al., 2020).
Impaired type I interferon response was shown to be involved
in patients with life-threatening COVID-19 (Bastard et al., 2020;
Zhang Q. et al., 2020). The Ro is estimated to be between 2 and
3 (Petersen et al., 2020). COVID-19 has spread globally within a
few months leading to more than 74 million contaminations and
more than 1.6 million deaths worldwide as of December 18, 2020
(World Health Organization [WHO], 2020e).
Multiple public health measures have been implemented by
most countries such as individual actions (physical distancing,
hand washing, use of face masks and cough etiquette),
identiﬁcation of clusters (case identiﬁcation, contact tracing and
isolation), regulatory actions (school closure, workplace closure,
stay-at-home order, public transport closure and restriction,
limits on size of gatherings and business capacity), closures
of internal and international borders, travel restrictions and
enforced quarantine. The goal of these public health measures
being to delay and ﬂatten the epidemic curve, preventing
overwhelming capacity of the health care system and protecting
individuals at highest risk of severe outcome before safe and
eﬀective vaccines and treatments are available. However, in
contrast to SARS-CoV, viral shedding in patients with COVID-
19 starts a few days before symptom onset (pre-symptomatic)
and some patients remain asymptomatic while they shed the
virus which make case isolation measures less eﬃcient (Ganyani
et al., 2020). In less than a year (as of December 11, 2020), a ﬁrst
vaccine based on a new platform consisting of mRNA encoding
the spike protein of the virus (developed by Pﬁzer/BioNTech)
has been granted for Emergency Use designation by the US
FDA. Several other vaccines based on inactivated whole virus,
recombinant non-replicative viral vector, recombinant spike
protein and virus-like particles are in late phases of clinical
investigation (Batty et al., 2020). The antiviral remdesivir
(a repurposed drug initially developed for the treatment of
Ebola virus) received US FDA Emergency Use Authorization
for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19
requiring supplemental oxygen. The anti-inﬂammatory drug
dexamethasone was recommended for critically ill patients with
COVID-19 by the WHO (Lamontagne et al., 2020).
HOW TO PREVENT A FUTURE
PANDEMIC?
Plague and cholera pandemics ﬁrst disseminated along trade and
military routes. Thereafter, the geographical spread of pathogens
followed the movement of human population through rail,
ship and air travels. Nowadays, the globalization of travels and
trade of animals and animal-based foods further increase the
spread of infectious diseases and the speed with which they are
disseminated around the world. Land use and urbanization to
accommodate agriculture and living areas modify the habitats of
pathogens, hosts and disease vectors and aﬀect the transmission
dynamics of infections to humans. The geographic distribution
of disease vectors and hosts as well as the living habitats of
microorganisms is also aﬀected by climate changes and could
potentially increase the spread of pathogens. Increased contacts
between humans and animals through breeding, hunting, wet
markets and trade of exotic pets also favor the risk of spillover
of zoonotic pathogens. The spread of infectious diseases is
thus expected to increase due to human activities and their
eﬀects on the environment. Epidemics and pandemics will
also occur more frequently and will represent new challenges
for public health.
In order to control the transmission of water-borne pathogens
such as V. cholera, the WHO has launched a water, sanitation

History of Pandemics
and hygiene (WASH) program in developing countries (Matilla
et al., 2018). This program emphasizes the provision of safe and
clean sources of water, eﬀective sanitation infrastructure and
ensures appropriate hygiene practices. The WASH program was
reported to increase safe drinking water accesses, safe sanitation
services and basic handwashing facilities with soap and water at
home to 71%, 45% and 60% of the global population, respectively
(UNICEF and World Health Organization [WHO], 2019).
Vector control is the primary tool to control vector-borne
diseases such as malaria, Dengue virus, Chikungunya virus and
Zika virus (Wilson A.L. et al., 2020). These methods can target
either the immature stages (by the use of predator species
and chemical or biological larvicides or by the modiﬁcation
of the habitat) or the adult vectors (by the use of nets,
topical repellents, insecticides and spraying). Furthermore, novel
vector control methods are under development such as the
genetic manipulation of mosquitos (Hammond and Galizi, 2017),
bacterial infection of vectors (e.g., Wolbachia) (Flores and
O’Neill, 2018) and eave tubes with insecticide-laden electrostatic
netting (Knols et al., 2016). However, the development of novel
vector control tools is still needed.
The implementation of global surveillance programs for the
rapid detection of pathogen spillover from animal to the human
population is of prime importance. The One Health concept
promotes optimal health for human, animal and environment
(One Health Commission [OHC], 2020). The environmental
eﬀects resulting from land use, urbanization and climate changes
may increase the risk of pathogens spillover from animals
to humans and emphasize the importance of a One Health
integrative approach for the surveillance of zoonosis (Okello
et al., 2011; Rabozzi et al., 2012). Such integrative approaches are
used to implement surveillance programs for the prevention and
control of emerging and re-emerging infections in developing
countries. These multidisciplinary eﬀorts could have positive
impacts in these countries as they are the most aﬄicted by the
eﬀects of zoonoses (Bidaisee and Macpherson, 2014).
Viral zoonoses constitute particularly a serious threat to
public health as viruses were at the origin of the most recent
pandemics. It is thus important to evaluate the risk of cross-
species transmission of viruses to humans. The viral richness
associated to an animal species could predict zoonotic potential
of mammalian viruses (Olival et al., 2017). It was shown that
the cross-species transmission of mammalian viruses increases
with respect to the phylogenetic proximity between hosts and
humans. Furthermore, viruses that infect a phylogenetically
broader ranges of hosts are more likely to be zoonotic.
Characterizing the diversity of viruses in key wildlife species
will help to reduce the time between detection and response
during an outbreak (Epstein and Anthony, 2017). Furthermore,
the global virome project was launched to detect and identify
viral threats to human health, characterize the host ranges of
viruses, identify behaviors that favor spillover, establish a global
surveillance network and identify transmission and pathogenicity
markers for high-risk viruses (Carroll et al., 2018; Kwok et al.,
2020). Viral metagenomic next-generation sequencing analysis of
nasal/throat swabs from individuals at risk of zoonotic infections
was also used to expand the detection of novel viruses and the
characterization of the respiratory virome of humans exposed to
animals (Thi Kha Tu et al., 2020).
CONCLUDING REMARKS
The time of onset and the pathogen that will cause the next
pandemic are unpredictable. Therefore, pandemic preparedness
plans emphasize that non-pharmaceutical interventions should
be implemented ﬁrst to control human-to-human transmission
of the pathogen. Ideally, these interventions should adequately
control the spread of an infection while minimizing societal
and economic disruption. Risks of resurgence can follow
once these non-pharmaceutical interventions are lifted. Once
available, rapid testing together with contact tracing (Teixeira
and Doetsch, 2020) and isolation of infected individuals
should
be
put
in
place
for
a
more
eﬀective
response.
Furthermore, pharmaceutical interventions including rapid
point-of-care diagnostic tests (Hussein et al., 2020), biomarkers
for disease stratiﬁcation (Maertzdorf et al., 2016), broad
spectrum antimicrobials/antivirals obtained through in silico
drug repurposing (Mangione et al., 2020) or by the use of drugs
targeting host cells (Lee and Yen, 2012) as well as new platforms
for accelerated vaccine development and production (Rauch
et al., 2018) should be developed to improve the global response
to the pandemic.

The United Kingdom’s COVID-19 epidemic during early 2020 was one of world’s largest and was unusually
well represented by virus genomic sampling. We determined the fine-scale genetic lineage structure of
this epidemic through analysis of 50,887 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
genomes, including 26,181 from the UK sampled throughout the country’s first wave of infection. Using
large-scale phylogenetic analyses combined with epidemiological and travel data, we quantified the size,
spatiotemporal origins, and persistence of genetically distinct UK transmission lineages. Rapid fluctuations
in virus importation rates resulted in >1000 lineages; those introduced prior to national lockdown tended to
be larger and more dispersed. Lineage importation and regional lineage diversity declined after lockdown,
whereas lineage elimination was size-dependent. We discuss the implications of our genetic perspective on
transmission dynamics for COVID-19 epidemiology and control.
I
nfectious disease epidemics are composed
of chains of transmission, yet surprisingly
little is known about how co-circulating
transmission lineages vary in size, spatial
distribution, and persistence, or how key
properties such as epidemic size and duration
arise from their combined action. Although
individual-level contact-tracing investigations
can reconstruct the structure of small-scale
transmission clusters [e.g., (1–3)], they cannot
be extended practically to large national epi-
demics. However, recent studies of Ebola, Zika,
influenza, and other viruses have demonstrated
that virus emergence and spread can instead
be tracked using large-scale pathogen genome
sequencing [e.g., (4–7)]. Such studies show
that regional epidemics can be highly dynamic
at the genetic level, with recurrent importa-
tion and extinction of transmission chains
within a given location. In addition to mea-
suring genetic diversity, understanding path-
ogen lineage dynamics can help researchers
to target interventions effectively [e.g., (8, 9)],
track variants with potentially different pheno-
types [e.g., (10, 11)], and improve the interpre-
tation of incidence data [e.g., (12, 13)].
The rate and scale of virus genome sequenc-
ing worldwide during the COVID-19 pan-
demic has been unprecedented, with >100,000
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona-
virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes shared online
by 1 October 2020 (14). About half of these
represent infections in the United Kingdom
and were generated by the national COVID-19
Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium (15). The
UK experienced one of the largest epidemics
worldwide during the first half of 2020. Num-
bers of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests rose in
March and peaked in April; by 26 June, there
had been 40,453 nationally notified COVID-19
deaths in the UK [deaths occurring ≤28 days
after first positive test (16)]. Here, we combine
this large genomic dataset with epidemiolog-
ical and travel data to provide a full charac-
terization of the genetic structure and lineage
dynamics of the UK epidemic.
Our study encompasses the initial epidemic
wave of COVID-19 in the UK and comprises
all SARS-CoV-2 genomes available before
26 June 2020 (50,887 genomes, of which 26,181
were from the UK; Fig. 1A) (17). The data re-
present genomes from 9.29% of confirmed UK
COVID-19 cases by 26 June (16). Further, using
an estimate of the actual size of the UK epi-
demic (18), we infer that virus genomes were
generated for 0.66% [95% confidence inter-
val (CI), 0.46 to 0.95%] of all UK infections
by 5 May (Fig. 1B).
Genetic structure and lineage dynamics of the
UK epidemic from January to June
We first sought to identify and enumerate all
independently introduced, genetically distinct
chains of infection within the UK. We de-
veloped a large-scale molecular clock phyloge-
netic pipeline to identify “UK transmission
lineages” that (i) contain two or more UK
genomes and (ii) descend from an ancestral
lineage inferred to exist outside of the UK
(Fig. 2, A and B). Sources of statistical uncer-
tainty in lineage assignation were taken into
account (17). We identified a total of 1179 [95%
highest posterior density (HPD), 1143 to 1286]
UK transmission lineages. Although each is
intended to capture a chain of local transmis-
sion arising from a single importation event,
some UK transmission lineages will be un-
observed or aggregated as a result of limited
SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity (19) or incom-
plete or uneven genome sampling (20, 21).
Therefore we expect this number to be an

underestimate (17). In our phylogenetic anal-
ysis, 1650 (95% HPD, 1611 to 1783) UK genomes
could not be allocated to a UK transmission
lineage (singletons). Had more genomes been
sequenced, it is likely that many of these
singletons would have been assigned to a UK
transmission lineage. Further, many singleton
importations are likely to be unobserved.
Most transmission lineages are small, and
72.4% (95% HPD, 69.3 to 72.9%) contain <10
genomes (Fig. 2C). However, the lineage size
distribution is strongly skewed and follows a
power-law distribution (Fig. 2C, inset), such
that the eight largest UK transmission line-
ages contain >25% of all sampled UK genomes
(Fig. 2D; figs. S2 to S5 show further visual-
izations). Although the two largest transmis-
sion lineages are estimated to comprise >1500
UK genomes each, there is phylogenetic un-
certainty in their sizes (95% HPDs, 1280 to
2133 and 1342 to 2011 genomes, respectively).
Because our dataset constitutes only a small
fraction of all UK infections, these observed
lineage sizes will underestimate true lineage
size. However, the true distribution of relative
lineage sizes will closely match our observa-
tion, and its power-law shape indicates that
almost all unobserved lineages will be small.
All eight largest lineages were first detected
before the UK national lockdown was an-
nounced on 23 March and, as expected, larger
lineages were observed for longer (Pearson’s
r = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.8 to 0.83; fig. S7). The
sampling frequency of lineages of varying sizes
differed over time (Fig. 3A and figs. S8 and S9);
whereas UK transmission lineages containing
>100 genomes consistently accounted for >40%
of weekly sampled genomes, the proportion
of small transmission lineages (≤10 genomes)
and singletons decreased over the course of
the epidemic (Fig. 3A).
The detection of UK transmission lineages
in our data changed markedly through time.
In early March, the epidemic was character-
ized by lineages first observed within the prev-
ious week (Fig. 3B). The per-genome rate of
appearance of new lineages was initially high,
then declined throughout March and April
(Fig. 3C), such that by 1 May, 96.2% of sampled
genomes belonged to transmission lineages
that were first observed >7 days previously. By
1 June, a growing number of lineages (>73%)
had not been detected by genomic sampling
for >4 weeks, which suggests that they were
rare or had gone extinct; this result is robust
to the sampling rate (Fig. 1, A and B, and Fig.
3C). Together, these results indicate that the
UK’s first epidemic wave resulted from the
concurrent growth of many hundreds of inde-
pendently introduced transmission lineages,
and that the introduction of nonpharma-
ceutical interventions (NPIs) was followed by
the apparent extinction of lineages in a size-
dependent manner.
Transmission lineage diversity and
geographic range
We also characterized the spatial distribution
of UK transmission lineages using available
data on 107 virus genome sampling locations,
which correspond broadly to UK counties or
metropolitan regions (data S1). Although ge-
nomes were not collected randomly [some
lineages and regions will be overrepresented
because of targeted investigation of local out-
breaks; e.g., (22)], the number of UK lineages
detected in each region correlates with the num-
ber of genomes sequenced (Fig. 4A; Pearson’s
r = 0.96; 95% CI, 0.95 to 0.98) and the number
of reported cases (fig. S10; Pearson’s r = 0.53;
95% CI, 0.35 to 0.67; see also data S2) in each
region. Further, larger lineages were observed
in more locations; every 100 additional genomes
in a lineage increases its observed range by
six or seven regions (Fig. 4B; Pearson’s r = 0.8;
95% CI, 0.78 to 0.82). Thus, bigger regional
epidemics comprised a greater diversity of

and TMRCA B is observed if only genomes 3 to 5
are sampled. (C) Distribution of UK transmission

transmission lineages, and larger lineages were
more geographically widespread. These obser-
vations indicate substantial dissemination
of a subset of lineages across the UK and sug-
gest that many regions experienced a series
of introductions of new lineages from else-
where, potentially hindering the impact of
local interventions.
We quantified the substantial variationamong
regions in the diversity of transmission line-
ages present using Shannon’s index (SI; this
value increases as both the number of lineages
and the evenness of their frequencies increase;
Fig. 4C and data S3). We observed the highest
SIs in Hertfordshire (4.77), Greater London
(4.62), and Essex (4.49); these locations are
characterized by frequent commuter travel
to or within London and proximity to major
international airports (23). Locations with
the three lowest nonzero SIs were in Scotland
(Stirling = 0.96, Aberdeenshire = 1.04, Inver-
clyde = 1.32; Fig. 4C). We speculate that regional
differences in transmission lineage diversity
may be related to the level of connectedness to
other regions.
To illustrate temporal trends in transmission
lineage diversity, we plotted SI through time for
each of the UK’s national capital cities (Fig. 4D).
Lineage diversities in each peaked in late March
and declined after the UK national lockdown,
congruentwithFig.3,CandD.GreaterLondon’s
epidemic was the most diverse and was charac-
terized by an early, rapid rise in SI (Fig. 4D),
consistent with epidemiological trends there
(16, 24). Belfast’s lineage diversity was notably
lower (data S4 shows other locations).
We observe variation in the spatial range of
individual UK transmission lineages. Although
some lineages are widespread, most are more
localized and the range size distribution is
right-skewed (fig. S11), congruent with an ob-
served abundance of small lineages (Figs. 2C
and 4B) and biogeographic theory [e.g., (25)].
For example, lineage DTA_13 is geographically
dispersed (>50% of sequence pairs sampled
>234 km apart), whereas DTA_290 is strongly
local (95% of sequence pairs sampled <100 km
apart) and DTA_62 has multiple foci of sam-
pled genomes (Fig. 4E and fig. S12). The
national distribution of cases therefore arose
from the aggregation of multiple heteroge-
neous lineage-specific patterns.
Dynamics of international introduction of
transmission lineages
The process by which transmission lineages are
introduced to an area is an important aspect
of early epidemic growth [e.g., (26)]. To in-
vestigate this at a national scale, we estimated
the rate and source of SARS-CoV-2 importa-
tions into the UK. Because standard phylogeo-
graphic approaches were precluded by strong
biases in genome sampling among countries
(20), we developed a new approach that com-
bines virus phylogenetics with epidemiological
and travel data. First, we estimated the TMRCA
(time of the most recent common ancestor) of
each UK transmission lineage (17). The TMRCAs
of most UK lineages are dated to March and
early April [median = 21 March; interquartile
range (IQR) = 14 to 29 March]. UK lineages with
earlier TMRCAs tend to be larger and longer-
lived than those whose TMRCAs postdate the
national lockdown (Fig. 5A and fig. S15).
Because of incomplete sampling, TMRCAs
best represent the date of the first inferred
transmission event in a lineage, not its import-
ation date (Fig. 2B). To infer the latter and to
quantify the delay between importation and
onward within-UK transmission, we gener-
ated daily estimates of the number of travelers
arriving in the UK and of global SARS-CoV-2
infections (17) worldwide. Before March, the
UK received ~1.75 million inbound travelers
per week (school holidays explain the end-
February ~10% increase; Fig. 5B). Internation-
al arrivals fell by ~95% during March, and this
reduction was maintained through April. Else-
where, estimated numbers of infectious cases
peaked in late March (Fig. 5B). We combined
these two trends to generate an estimated im-
portation intensity (EII), a daily empirical mea-
sure of the intensity of SARS-CoV-2 importation
into the UK (17). Because both travel volumes
and epidemic incidence fluctuate rapidly over
orders of magnitude, the EII is robust to other
sources of variation in the relative importation
risk among countries (17). The EII peaked in
mid-March, when high UK inbound travel vol-
umes coincided with growing numbers of in-
fectious cases elsewhere (Fig. 5, B and C).
Crucially, the EII’s temporal profile closely
matches, but precedes, that of the TMRCAs of
UK transmission lineages (Fig. 5, A and C).
The difference between the two represents the
“importation lag,” the time elapsed between
lineage importation and the first detected lo-
cal transmission event (Fig. 2B). Using a sta-
tistical model (17), we estimate importation
lag to be on average 8.22 ± 5.21 days (IQR =
3.35 to 15.18) across all transmission line-
ages. Further, importation lag is strongly
size-dependent; average lag is ~10 days for
lineages comprising ≤10 genomes and <1 day

for lineages of >100 genomes (table S2). This
size dependency likely arises because the
earliest transmission event in a lineage is
more likely to be captured if it contains many
genomes (Fig. 2B) (17). We use this model to
impute an importation date for each UK
transmission lineage (Fig. 5D). Importation
was unexpectedly dynamic, rising and falling
substantially over only 4 weeks; hence, 80%
of importations (that gave rise to detectable
UK transmission lineages) occurred between
27 February and 30 March. The delay between
the inferred date of importation and the first
genomic detection of each lineage was 14.13 ±
5.61 days on average (IQR = 10 to 18) and
declined through time (tables S2 and S3).
To investigate country-specific contributions
to virus importation, we generated separate EII
curves for each country (fig. S17). Using these
values, we estimated the numbers of inferred
importations each day attributable to inbound
travel from each source location. This assign-
ment is statistical and does not take the effects
of superspreading events into account. As with
the rate of importation (Fig. 5A), the relative
contributions of arrivals from different coun-
tries were dynamic (Fig. 5D). Dominant source
locations shifted rapidly in February and March,
and the diversity of source locations increased
in mid-March (fig. S17). The earliest importa-
tions were most likely from China or else-
where in Asia but were rare relative to those
from Europe. Over our study period, we infer
that ~33% of UK transmission lineages stemmed
from arrivals from Spain, 29% from France,
12% from Italy, and 26% from elsewhere (fig.
S20 and table S4). These large-scale trends
were not apparent from individual-level travel
histories; routine collection of such data ceased
on 12 March (27).
Conclusions
The exceptional size of our genomic survey
provides insight into the micro-epidemiological
patterns that underlie the features of a large,
national COVID-19 epidemic, allowing us to
quantify the abundance, size distribution, and
spatial range of transmission lineages. Before
the lockdown, high travel volumes and few re-
strictions on international arrivals (Fig. 5B
and table S5) led to the establishment and co-
circulation of >1000 identifiable UK transmis-
sion lineages (Fig. 5A), jointly contributing to
accelerated epidemic growth that quickly ex-
ceeded national contact-tracing capacity (27).
The relative contributions of importation and
local transmission to initial epidemic dynam-
ics under such circumstances warrant further
investigation. We expect that similar trends
occurred in other countries with comparably
large epidemics and high international travel
volumes; virus genomic studies from regions
with smaller or controlled COVID-19 epidemics
have reported high importation rates followed
by more transient lineage persistence [e.g.,
(28–30)].
Earlier lineages were larger, more dispersed,
and harder to eliminate, highlighting the im-
portance of rapid or preemptive interventions
in reducing transmission [e.g., (31–33)]. The
high heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 transmis-
sion at the individual level (34–36) appears to
extend to whole transmission lineages, such
that >75% of sampled viruses belong to the
top 20% of lineages ranked by size. Although
the national lockdown coincided with limited
importation and reduced regional lineage di-
versity, its impact on lineage extinction was
size-dependent (Fig. 3, B and C). The over-
dispersed nature of SARS-CoV-2 transmission
likely exacerbated this effect (37), thereby
favoring, as the epidemic reproduction num-
ber (Rt) declined, greater survival of larger
widespread lineages and faster local elimi-
nation of lineages in low-prevalence regions.
The degree to which the surviving lineages
contributed to the UK’s ongoing second epi-
demic, including the effect of specific muta-
tions on lineage growth rates [e.g., (11)], is
currently under investigation. The transmis-
sion structure and dynamics measured here
provide a new context in which future pub-
lic health actions at regional, national, and
international scales should be planned and
evaluated.

Lineage dynamics
The scale of genome-sequencing efforts for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is
unprecedented. The United Kingdom has contributed more than 26,000 sequences to this effort. This volume of data
allowed du Plessis et al. to develop a detailed picture of the influxes of virus reaching U.K. shores as the pandemic
developed during the first months of 2020 (see the Perspective by Nelson). Before lockdown, high travel volumes
and few restrictions on international travel allowed more than 1000 lineages to become established. This accelerated
local epidemic growth and exceeded contact tracing capacity. The authors were able to quantify the abundance, size
distribution, and spatial range of the lineages that were transmitted. Transmission was highly heterogeneous, favoring
some lineages that became widespread and subsequently harder to eliminate. This dire history indicates that rapid or
even preemptive responses should have been used as they were elsewhere where containment was successful.

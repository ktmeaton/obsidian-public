Summary
NCBImeta is a command-line application that downloads and organizes biological metadata
from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). While the NCBI web portal
provides an interface for searching and filtering molecular data, the output offers limited
options for record retrieval and comparison on a much larger and broader scale. NCBImeta
tackles this problem by creating a reformatted local database of NCBI metadata based on
user search queries and customizable fields. The output of NCBImeta, optionally a SQLite
database or text file(s), can then be used by computational biologists for applications such as
record filtering, project discovery, sample interpretation, and meta-analyses of published work.
Background
Recent technological advances in DNA sequencing have propelled biological research into the
realm of big data. Due to the tremendous output of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) plat-
forms, numerous fields have transformed to explore this novel high-throughput data. Projects
that quickly adapted to incorporate these innovative techniques included monitoring the emer-
gence of antibiotic resistance genes (Zankari et al., 2012), epidemic source tracking in human
rights cases (Eppinger et al., 2014), and global surveillance of uncharacterized organisms
(Connor et al., 2015). However, the startling rate at which sequence data are being deposited
online have presented significant hurdles to the efficient reuse of published data. In response,
there is growing recognition within the computational community that effective data mining
techniques are a dire necessity (Mackenzie, McNally, Mills, & Sharples, 2016; Nakazato, Ohta,
& Bono, 2013).
An essential step in the data mining process is the efficient retrieval of comprehensive meta-
data. These metadata fields are diverse in nature, but often include the characteristics of the
biological source material, the composition of the raw data, the objectives of the research ini-
tiative, and the structure of the post-processed data. Several software applications have been
developed to facilitate bulk metadata retrieval from online repositories. Of the available tools,
SRAdb (Zhu, Stephens, Meltzer, & Davis, 2013), the Pathogen Metadata Platform (Chang,
Peterson, Garay, & Korves, 2016), MetaSRA (Bernstein, Doan, & Dewey, 2017), and pysradb
(Choudhary, 2019) are among the most widely utilised and actively maintained. While these
software extensions offer substantial improvements over the NCBI web browser experience,
there remain several outstanding issues.
1. Existing tools assume external programming language proficiency (ex. R, Python, SQL),
thus reducing tool accessibility.

2. Available software focuses on implementing access to singular NCBI databases in isola-
tion, for example, the raw data repository the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). This does
not empower researchers to incorporate evidence from multiple databases, as it fails to
fully leverage the power of interconnected information within the relational database
scheme of NCBI.
3. Existing software provides only intermittent database updates, where users are depen-
dent on developers releasing new snapshots to gain access to the latest information.
This gives researchers less autonomy over what data they may incorporate as newer
records are inaccessible, and may even introduce sampling bias depending on when the
snapshots are generated.
In response, NCBImeta aims to provide a more user-inclusive experience to metadata retrieval,
that emphasizes real-time access and provides generalized frameworks for a wide variety of
NCBI’s databases.
NCBImeta
NBCImeta is a command-line application that executes user queries and metadata retrieval
from the NCBI suite of databases. The software is written in Python 3, using the BioPy
thon module (Cock et al., 2009) to connect to, search, and download XML records with
NCBI’s E-Utilities (Kans, 2019). The lxml package is utilised to perform XPath queries to
retrieve nodes containing biological metadata of interest. SQLite is employed as the database
management system for storing fetched records, as implemented with the sqlite3 python
module. Accessory scripts are provided to supply external annotation files, to join tables within
the local database so as to re-create the relational database structure, and finally to export
the database as tabular text for downstream analyses. NCBImeta currently interfaces with the
molecular and literature databases described in Table 1 (Entrez Help, 2016).

The typical workflow of NCBImeta follows four major steps as outlined in Figure 1. Users first
configure the program with their desired search terms. NCBImeta is then executed on the
command-line to fetch relevant records and organize them into a local database. Next, the
user optionally edits the database to, for example, add their own custom metadata. Finally,
the resulting database, kept in SQLite format or exported to text, delivers 100+ biologically-
relevant metadata fields to researcher’s fingertips. This process not only saves significant time
compared to manual record retrieval through the NCBI web portal, but additionally unlocks
attributes for comparison that were not easily accessible via the web-browser interface.

NCBImeta’s implementation offers a novel approach to metadata management and presenta-
tion that improves upon the prevously described limitations of existing software in a number
of ways. First, NCBImeta is run on the command-line, and the final database can be exported
to a text file, thus no knowledge of an external programming language is required to generate
or explore the output. Second, a general parsing framework for tables and metadata fields was
developed which can be extended to work with diverse database types contained within NCBI’s
infrastructure. Finally, a query system was implemented for record retrieval that allows users
to access records in real-time, as opposed to working with intermittent or out-dated database
snapshots.
Use Case
The following section demonstrates how NCBImeta can be used to obtain current and compre-
hensive metadata for a pathogenic bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, from various sequencing
projects across the globe. P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen associated with the dis-
ease cystic fibrosis (CF) and is highly adaptable to diverse ecological niches (Stewart et al.,
2014). As such, it is a target of great interest for comparative genomics and there are cur-
rently over 15,000 genomic sequence records available which are spread across two or more
databases. In cases such as this, it is critical to leverage the tremendous power of these existing
datasets while being conscious of the labor typically required to retrieve and contextualize this
information. NCBImeta renders the problem of acquiring and sifting through this metadata
trivial and facilitates the integration of information from multiple sources.
To identify publicly available P. aeruginosa genomes, NCBImeta is configured to search through
the tables Assembly (assembled genomes) and SRA (raw data).
For additional context,
NCBImeta is used to retrieve metadata from the Nucleotide table for descriptive statistics of
the genomic content, from the BioProject table to examine the research methodology of the
initiative, from Pubmed to identify existing publications, and finally from the Biosample table
to explore characteristics of the biological material. A small subset of the 100+ retrieved
columns is shown in Figure 2, to provide a visual example of the output format and the
metadata that is retrieved.

Subsequently, the output of NCBImeta can be used for exploratory data visualization and
analysis. The text file export function of NCBImeta ensures downstream compatibility with
both user-friendly online tools (ex. Google Sheets Charts) as well as more advanced visual-
ization packages (Wickham, 2016). In Figure 3, the geospatial distribution of P. aeruginosa
isolates are plotted alongside key aspects of genomic composition (ex. number of genes).

of samples in this region highlights a large number originating in Japan. Visualized with Palladio
(https://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/). B) The number of genes per organism reveals a multi-modal
distribution within the species.
Finally, NCBImeta can be used to streamline the process of primary data acquisition following
careful filtration. FTP links are provided as metadata fields for databases attached to an FTP
server (ex. Assembly, SRA) which can be used to download biological data for downstream
analysis.
Future Work
The development of NCBImeta has primarily focused on a target audience of researchers
whose analytical focus is prokaryotic genomics and the samples of interest are the organisms
themselves. Chief among those include individuals pursuing questions concerning epidemi-
ology, phylogeography, and comparative genomics. Future releases of NCBImeta will seek

to broaden database representation to include gene-centric and transcriptomics research (ex.

Abstract
Background: Québec was the Canadian province most impacted by COVID-19, with 401,462 cases as of September
24th, 2021, and 11,347 deaths due mostly to a very severe first pandemic wave. In April 2020, we assembled the
Coronavirus Sequencing in Québec (CoVSeQ) consortium to sequence SARS-CoV-2 genomes in Québec to track
viral introduction events and transmission within the province.
Methods: Using genomic epidemiology, we investigated the arrival of SARS-CoV-2 to Québec. We report 2921
high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the context of > 12,000 publicly available genomes sampled globally over the
first pandemic wave (up to June 1st, 2020). By combining phylogenetic and phylodynamic analyses with
epidemiological data, we quantify the number of introduction events into Québec, identify their origins, and
characterize the spatiotemporal spread of the virus.
Results: Conservatively, we estimated approximately 600 independent introduction events, the majority of which
happened from spring break until 2 weeks after the Canadian border closed for non-essential travel. Subsequent
mass repatriations did not generate large transmission lineages (> 50 sequenced cases), likely due to mandatory
quarantine measures in place at the time. Consistent with common spring break and “snowbird” destinations, most
of the introductions were inferred to have originated from Europe via the Americas. Once introduced into Québec,
viral lineage sizes were overdispersed, with a few lineages giving rise to most infections. Consistent with founder
effects, the earliest lineages to arrive tended to spread most successfully. Fewer than 100 viral introductions arrived
during spring break, of which 7–12 led to the largest transmission lineages of the first wave (accounting for 52–75%
of all sequenced infections). These successful transmission lineages dispersed widely across the province.
Transmission lineage size was greatly reduced after March 11th, when a quarantine order for returning travellers
was enacted. While this suggests the effectiveness of early public health measures, the biggest transmission
lineages had already been ignited prior to this order.

Conclusions: Combined, our results reinforce how, in the absence of tight travel restrictions or quarantine measures,
fewer than 100 viral introductions in a week can ensure the establishment of extended transmission chains.
Background
Over a year into the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, whole-
genome sequencing combined with phylogenetic analysis
has emerged as an essential tool to track the local and
global spread and evolution of the virus [1, 2]. While the
pandemic is global by definition, regional instances of
viral introductions and spread provide “natural experi-
ments” to gain insights into general patterns. For ex-
ample, Russia, Scotland, Zimbabwe, and Massachusetts
all experienced dozens to a few hundred independent
introduction events of the virus from different locations
[3–6]. A phylogenetic analysis of Massachusetts in par-
ticular found that most introduced viruses went extinct,
while a minority of introductions were highly successful,
consistent with superspreading dynamics [5]. Phylogen-
etic analysis can also identify cryptic transmission chains
unidentified by contact tracing or travel history [7, 8].
Combinations of genomics, travel history, and contact
tracing can provide deeper and more robust insights into
transmission chains [9]. More recently, evidence has ac-
cumulated that transmissibility can be increased by
adaptive mutations in the viral genome, such as amino
acid change D614G in the spike protein [10, 11], or
combinations of mutations, as in the B.1.1.7 Pangolin
(PANGO) lineage [12], i.e., Alpha (WHO notation), that
emerged in Southeast England in September 2020 and
quickly became the predominant PANGO lineage in the
UK [13]. The interplay between adaptive evolution, such
as beneficial mutations, and stochastic factors, such as
founder effects and superspreading, remains to be fully
explored, and additional case studies are instructive to
distinguish region-specific from generalizable features of
the pandemic.
The province of Québec (QC) was the epicenter of the
first wave in Canada of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (de-
fined here up to June 1st, 2020). It is the second most
populous province, with about half of its 8.5 million in-
habitants in the densely populated Montréal metropol-
itan area. By June 1st, 2020, 5210 people in Québec had
died of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), of whom
70% were residents of long-term care facilities. When
the first cases were reported in China and Europe, the
Public Health Laboratory of Québec (LSPQ) developed a
qPCR diagnostic test targeting SARS-CoV-2 E and N
genes [14]. The first case of COVID-19 in Québec was
detected on February 25th, 2020. Shortly after, Québec
was the first large Canadian province to start its spring
school holiday (“spring break;” February 29th to March
9th, 2020; Fig. 1A). It is believed that international
travellers returning from spring break had a large impact
on the epidemic [17]. The number of cases increased ex-
ponentially during March 2020 (Fig. 1A [18];). On
March 13th, a public health emergency was declared,
with schools, daycares, and most other public spaces
closed on March 16th (“lockdown”). The closure of the
Canadian border to non-essential travel was also an-
nounced March 16th and officially closed the night of
the 17th, except for returning Canadian citizens who
continued to enter the country after repatriation calls
from the government. On March 20th, Québec reached
the threshold of 100 cases per day and by March 28th
random road checks were set up to discourage move-
ment between regions within Québec and between
neighboring provinces (i.e., movement between Gati-
neau, Québec, bordering Ottawa, Ontario, was re-
stricted). In April 2020, the virus spread significantly in
long-term care facilities overwhelming many of them,
thus requiring redeployment of health care workers and
by
April
20th
the
Canadian
Armed
Forces
sent
personnel to the Montréal region to help. Having flat-
tened the epidemic curve and with cases declining, pub-
lic health measures began easing mid-May (Fig. 1A). A
year and a half later, as of September 24th, 2021, Québec
had suffered the highest death toll in Canada (over
11,000 dead) and among the highest death rates in the
world (~ 132 deaths per 100,000).
In April 2020, we assembled the Coronavirus Sequen-
cing in Québec (CoVSeQ) consortium of academic and
government scientists (https://covseq.ca/) to sequence
SARS-CoV-2 genomes in Québec. The CoVSeQ consor-
tium is part of the Canadian COVID Genomic Network
(CanCOGeN), a pan-Canadian cross-agency network for
large-scale SARS-CoV-2 and human host sequencing
(https://www.genomecanada.ca/en/cancogen). To better
understand the early introductions and spread of SARS-
CoV-2 in Québec during the first wave, we sequenced
and analyzed 2921 high-quality consensus genome se-
quences obtained between mid-February and June 1st,
2020. We studied how these Québec sequences were re-
lated to 12,801 genomes sampled from elsewhere in
Canada and internationally. We inferred geographical
origins of introduction events by comparing travel his-
tory data with phylogenetic inference (Additional file 1:
Figure S1) and estimated their likely arrival dates and
subsequent spread. We conservatively estimated ~ 600
independent
introduction
events,
mainly
involving
PANGO lineages of European origin, of which the most
successful arrived early. Most viral lineages rapidly went

extinct after being introduced into Québec, and only 7–
12 introduction events gave rise to 50 or more se-
quenced cases. This overdispersed distribution of trans-
mission lineage sizes was also documented in the greater
Boston
area
and
is
thought
to
be
driven
by
superspreading dynamics [5]. Consistent with founder
effects, earlier introductions tended to give rise to more
subsequent infections. Later introduction events were
less successful, which also points to the effectiveness of
public health measures in curbing local transmission.

Methods
Sampling and sequencing
COVID-19-positive cases were selected from all naso-
pharyngeal swabs sent to the Public Health Laboratory
of Québec (Laboratoire de Santé Public du Québec,
LSPQ) from the beginning of the pandemic until June
1st, 2020. In this period, we aimed to sequence as many
samples as possible, though coverage dropped after late
March 2020. Here we present 2921 high-quality SARS-
CoV-2 genomes (Additional file 2: Table S1). Our se-
quencing strategy during this time had no specific bias
towards outbreaks. The dataset is therefore relatively un-
biased, with the caveat that the sampling strategy during
the first wave was biased towards travellers, those with
symptoms, and those directly exposed to a case. We
attempted sequencing of all randomly selected qPCR-
positive samples, without any filter for a particular cycle
threshold (Ct) value. To protect patient confidentiality,
in the publicly released data the first accurate date of
sampling is set to March 10th, 2020. All samples taken
before that are set to March 1st, and their real sampling
dates are between February 25th and March 9th, 2020.
The true sampling dates were used in phylogenetic ana-
lyses described below. Note that our dataset of 2921
consensus sequences is available through GISAID and
the Canadian SARS-CoV-2 repository, CanCoGen’s Vir-
usSeq Portal https://virusseq-dataportal.ca/explorer
(Additional file 2: Table S1).
Total nucleic acid extraction was performed with the
NucliSENS EASYMAG automated platform on 200 μL of
nasopharyngeal swabs. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 was
assessed by a qPCR diagnostic test targeting genes E and N
[14]. Targeted SARS-CoV-2 amplification, library prepar-
ation, and sequencing were performed at the McGill Gen-
ome Centre as follows. Briefly, RNA samples were processed
in a 96-well plate format, including positive and negative
controls on each plate. A targeted amplification strategy was
used based on the ARTIC V3 primer scheme (https://github.
com/artic-network/artic-ncov2019
[19])
using
the
V3
primers only without adding the redundant V1 primers. For
primer pairs 5, 17, 23, 26, 66, 70, 74, 91, 97, and 64, for which
a lower coverage was observed, a separate additional low
amplification (LA1) pool was prepared to increase the num-
ber of reads in the corresponding region. For post-PCR
cleanup, pools 1 and 2 were combined, while pool LA1 was
cleaned up separately, quantified, and added to the combined
pools 1 + 2 in equimolar concentration. Samples from plates
1–4 were prepared for Nanopore sequencing as described:
https://www.protocols.io/view/sars-cov-2-mcgill-nanopore-
sequencing-protocol-sup-bjajkicn. For Nanopore sequencing,
we used native barcodes on pooled amplicons and loaded
20–40 ng of library onto the flow cell. Samples from plates
5–8 were prepared for Nextera Flex Illumina sequencing as
described:
https://www.protocols.io/view/sars-cov-2-mcgill-
nextera-flex-sequencing-protocol-bisbkean. For samples
sequenced on Illumina, the Nextera Flex kit was used
starting from 150 ng of DNA following the procedure
from the manufacturer. Plate 9 was sequenced using
both Nanopore and Illumina technologies, as well as by
applying the Cleanplex assay by Paragon Genomics,
followed by MGI sequencing. For samples that were se-
quenced more than once, the data with the higher cover-
age was used to generate consensus sequences and
subsequent phylogenetic analysis. For the Cleanplex
assay, we used the Cleanplex for MGI SARS-CoV-2 re-
search panel by Paragon Genomics. The assay utilizes
343 primer pairs tiled across the viral genome as de-
scribed [20]. The manufacturer’s protocol (UG4002-1)
was used, with the modification of increasing the multi-
plex PCR cycle number to 16 in order to improve the se-
quencing of samples with qPCR Ct values of > 29,
followed by sequencing on an MGI DNBSEQ G400
instrument.
Basecalling and consensus sequence generation
All samples were aligned to the reference genome of the
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 iso-
late Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank Accession MN908947.3)
[21]. Aligned reads were then used to produce a consen-
sus sequence using pipelines based on the Artic Network
novel coronavirus bioinformatics protocol (https://artic.
network/ncov-2019/ncov2019-bioinformatics-sop.html).
A brief description of the pipeline, including software
packages and important parameters, is provided for each
sequencing platform below.
Datasets produced using the Nextera Flex Illumina
protocol were first filtered to remove any host reads. To
do so, reads were aligned to a hybrid reference including
SARS-CoV-2 (MN908947.3) and GRCh38 using bwa-
mem (v0.7.17) [22]. Any reads mapping to a region of
the human reference with a mapping quality of zero or
more were removed from the dataset. After filtering out
host reads, the remaining reads were trimmed using
cutadapt (v2.10) [23], then aligned to the SARS-CoV-2
reference (MN908947.3) using bwa-mem (v0.7.17) [22].
After alignment, reads were filtered using sambamba
(v0.7.0) [24] to remove paired reads with an insert size
outside of the 60–300-bp range, as well as any un-
mapped reads, secondary alignments and reads that did
not match the FR/RF orientation. iVar (v1.3) [25] was
used to trim any remaining primers. Samtools (v1.9) [26]
was used to produce a pileup which was then used as in-
put by iVar (v1.3) to create a consensus sequence for re-
gions with a minimum of 10× depth, using reads with a
Q score > 20 and a minimum allele frequency of 0.75. A
full description of the process can be found here:

https://c3g.github.io/covseq_McGill/SARS_CoV2_
Sequencing/Illumina_overview.html.
Datasets produced using the CleanPlex MGI protocol
were processed using the same pipeline as Illumina Nex-
tera Flex samples, except that Artic Network primers
and amplicon data was changed to the corresponding
CleanPlex information. A full description of the process
can be found here:
https://c3g.github.io/covseq_McGill/SARS_CoV2_
Sequencing/MGI_overview.html.
Raw data produced using Nanopore sequencing was
basecalled using guppy (v3.4.4) [27] with a High-
Accuracy Model (dna_r9.4.1_450bps_hac). Reads were
de-multiplexed using guppy barcodes (v3.4.4), requiring
barcodes on both ends. Reads were filtered by size to re-
move anything outside of the 400–700 bp range using
the ARTIC Network “guppyplex” tool. Reads were
aligned with minimap2 (v2.17) [28], then filtered to re-
move incorrect primer pairs and randomly downsample
high-depth regions to keep 800× depth per strand using
the ARTIC network framework. Nanopolish (v0.13.1)
[29] was used to call variants in regions with a minimum
depth of 16× and a flank of 10 bp. After masking regions
with coverage below 20×, the called variants were used
to generate a consensus sequence using bcftools (v1.9)
[26] consensus. A full description of the process can be
found here:
https://c3g.github.io/covseq_McGill/SARS_CoV2_
Sequencing/ONT_overview.html.
For samples sequenced with two or more technologies,
all datasets were processed separately using the methods
described above. The resulting consensus sequences
were compared to keep only the most complete consen-
sus for downstream analyses, as determined based on
the number of missing bases (Ns). After excluding con-
sensus sequences with > 5% Ns, we were left with 2921
consensus sequences for further analysis (83.14% passing
rate). The consensus sequences were deposited in GISA
ID under accession numbers listed in Additional file 2:
Table S1. The raw sequence data is available in NCBI as
described in the “Availability of data and materials” sec-
tion below. The list of authors and laboratories for con-
sensus
sequences
obtained
from
GISAID

Additional file 3: Table S2.
Positive and negative controls
Across our dataset, we included two types of negative
controls and two types of positive controls:
– Extraction-negative controls (Ext controls) consist of
a water blank included in every plate of samples
before extraction. They are processed alongside the
samples from RNA extraction onwards.
– Reverse transcription-negative control (RT control)
consist of an extraction buffer blank included in
plates before reverse transcription. They are proc-
essed alongside the samples from reverse transcrip-
tion onwards.
– Viral culture-positive control consists of a sample of
RNA extracted from a viral culture of B.1 lineage
with 6 known SNVs. They are processed alongside
the samples from reverse transcription onwards.
– Accukit RNA/cDNA positive control
(Accugenomics Inc., Catalog number 1231) consists
of artificial RNA or cDNA molecules with
introduced SNVs every 90 bp. The artificial
molecules do not cover the whole genome, and the
RNA version covers 94% of the SARS-CoV2 genome
whereas the cDNA version covers 83% of the SARS-
CoV2 genome. They are processed alongside sam-
ples from reverse transcription (RNA) or right after
(cDNA) depending on the kind of control used. For
more information, consult the provider’s website at
https://accugenomics.com/accukit-sars-cov-2/.
Please be aware that for this dataset, a previous ver-
sion of the kit was used; notably, the cDNA version
of this kit is no longer available.
All cases detected before March 17, 2020, were proc-
essed in plates that included only extraction-negative
controls and viral culture-positive controls. Samples de-
tected after that date were processed in plates including
all four controls (with only one of the two versions of
the AccuKit control included). All controls were proc-
essed using the same bioinformatic pipelines as the rest
of the samples.
For a plate to pass quality controls, extraction controls
were not allowed to have more than 2× average depth of
coverage or produce a consensus sequence covering
more than 1% of the genome length. During processing,
only two plates out of a total of 42 plates failed this test,
and samples in those plates were repeated. Reverse tran-
scription controls had the same threshold as extraction
controls, but none of them exceeded these thresholds
during processing.
Positive controls were evaluated based on coverage
(consensus sequences of Accukit controls should not ex-
ceed their length based on the % of the genome covered
by the kit) and by the detection of the known SNVs. All
positive controls passed these evaluations.
Phylogenetic analysis
Raw and time-scaled phylogenomic trees were built using
the NextStrain pipeline (https://github.com/nextstrain, ver-
sion 1.16.2) [30] installed in a conda environment (https://
github.com/conda/conda, version 4.8.3). This pipeline uses
the
Augur
toolkit
(https://github.com/nextstrain/augur,
Murall et al. Genome Medicine          (2021) 13:169 
Page 5 of 17
version 7.0.2) [31] to filter, align/mask genomic sequences,
build trees (divergence and time-scaled), and produce an out-
put file processed by the Auspice web interface (https://
github.com/nextstrain/auspice, version 2.16.0) [30] to explore
phylodynamic and phylogenomic data. Augur removed all
sequences shorter than 27,500 bp and sampled after June 1st,
2020. The Augur/align module was then called to execute
the multiple sequence alignment with MAFFT (https://
github.com/GSLBiotech/mafft, version v7.463) [32] using
Wuhan-1 (Genbank accession MN908947) as a reference
genome. The final alignment was masked at the beginning
(first 100 sites) and end (last 50 sites), and at positions 18529,
29849, 29851, and 29853 (sites of known low sequencing
quality and homoplasies). We then used Augur to select se-
quences from GISAID that were most similar to our 2921
Québec sequences. These global context sequences were
then grouped by country/month in order to keep a max-
imum of 100 sequences and 5 identical sequences per
country-month combination. In this way, a total of 12,801
genomes were pulled from GISAID on October 30th, 2020
(Additional file 3: Table S2).
We used IQ-TREE (http://www.iqtree.org/, version
1.6.12) [33] to construct a phylogenetic tree of Québec
only sequences and another tree of Québec and global
context sequences, with the GTR substitution model.
Branch lengths, sampling dates, and ancestral states
(geographic regions, nucleotides and amino acids se-
quences) at internal nodes were inferred with the
Augur/refine and Augur/traits modules by calling Tree-
Time
(https://github.com/neherlab/treetime,
version
0.7.5) [34] (using the same default parameters as those
chosen in public builds; https://github.com/nextstrain/
ncov). Finally, the Augur/export module exports a single
compiled results file required for data visualization in
Auspice. All Nexstrain analyses were executed on a 64-
bit CentOS server version 7.4.1708 using 40 CPUs.
Clade assignment was done during the NexStrain
build. As input, the Augur/clades module uses the
phylogenetic tree, the observed and inferred nucleotide
sequences at each node and a clade configuration file. In
this clade file, every single clade value is associated with
a specific combination of position/nucleotide variant. As
an alternative clade assignment scheme, we also used
the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak
LINeages [12] combined with lineages (https://github.
com/cov-lineages/lineages) version 2020-05-09 (Pangolin
2.3.2 and pangoLearn 2021-02-21, https://cov-lineages.
org/pangolin_docs/pangolearn.html).
To infer introduction events into Québec (QC), we
used discrete character ancestral state reconstruction
(ASR) to infer non-QC and QC nodes in the global con-
text time tree. Three methods were implemented in R
[35] using either (1) maximum likelihood (ace function
from ape package v5.4-1 [36], assuming the equal rates
model), or unordered Fitch parsimony implemented
with the fitch.mvsl function in mvSLOUCH v2.6.1 [37]
either with (2) delayed (DELTRAN) or (3) accelerated
(ACCTRAN) transformation algorithms in order to deal
with ambiguous nodes. With the reconstruction, we
assigned nodes to the QC state when supported by ≥
50% (with ML) or 1 (with parsimony) of the state assign-
ment. To find the transitions from non-QC to QC
nodes, first we identify every QC node or tip that is pre-
ceded by a non-QC node. Next, among this set of nodes,
we look for the most basal and discard every node that
is a descendant of another node in this set. The parents
of these remaining nodes are the non-QC node of the
transition and the introduction event is considered to
have happened within the transition. Note that these
methods likely underestimate the number of introduc-
tions. The non-QC to QC transitions were collected and
their most basal QC leaf (or leaves) are recorded. These
candidates were then cross-checked with travel history
data and were only recorded if at least one had travel
history. In the case of genetically identical genomes in
two travellers with the same travel history, we assumed
only one introduction event, which is a conservative esti-
mate, given that in principle both could cause secondary
infections in Québec. If only using travel history, they
would be counted as two separate introductions. In the
case of a polytomy with multiple basal QC sequences,
only one was chosen by the shortest branch length. If no
travel history was available, then the closest outgroup of
the introduction event was used to assign the likely ori-
gin of the introduction event. The descendants of these
identified transitions were used to define QC transmis-
sion lineages. The date of the non-QC node (prior to the
first QC node) was used as the TMRCA of the introduc-
tion event (Additional file 1: Figure S1). For the largest
QC transmission lineages (containing > 20 cases), the
TMRCA was also inferred using BEAST (see below).
Phylogenetic visualizations and dataset manipulation
were done in R using a suite of packages: ape [36], phy-
lotools [38], phytools [39], phangorn [40], tidyverse [41],
ggtree [42], and treeio [43].
Phylodynamics
The molecular clock signal was assessed by plotting the
root-to-tip phylogenetic distance against time using
TempEst [44]. The largest (> 20 sequenced cases) QC
transmission lineages were analyzed using Bayesian
phylogenetic tree reconstruction with Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) implemented in BEAST v2.6.2
[45] with the Birth-Death Skyline (BDSKY) model, as-
suming a gamma distributed Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano
(HYK) nucleotide substitution model (with a uniform
distribution 0.25 [0,1] of the nucleotide frequencies, a
lognormal 2 [0, ∞] for □, and a □ count of 4 with an

exponential distribution 0.5 [0, ∞]), and a strict molecu-
lar clock (0.8 × 10−3 substitutions/site/year). Using this
model, we estimated the effective reproduction number
(Re), TMRCA, and sampling proportion. The prior for
the reproduction number was a lognormal distribution
(initial = 2 [0,10], M = 0, S = 0.5), origin was a normal
distribution (mean = 0.1, □ = 0.05, initial 10[0,∞]), the
rate of becoming uninfectious was a normal distribution
(mean = 10, □ = 1.3, initial = 1[0,∞]), and sampling rate
was a beta distribution (□ = 1, □ = 5, initial = 0.01[0,1]).
All MCMC analyses were run with 50 million genera-
tions and sampling every 50,000 steps for lineages with
> 100 cases and 30 million generations and 30,000 steps
for lineages < 100 cases. Convergence was achieved
when all posteriors gave effective sample sizes (ESS) >
300 with 10% burn-in.
Calculation of population genetic metrics
We calculated Tajima’s D to infer changes of the viral
effective population size and deviation from a standard
neutral evolutionary model. We separated the data into
eight time periods of 2 weeks between February 20,
2020, and June 10, 2020. For each time period, we ran-
domly sampled 20 viral consensus sequences to calculate
Tajima’s D, and repeated this procedure 99 times to ob-
tain confidence intervals. We calculated both a com-
bined value of D across all sequences, and a separate
estimate for each PANGO viral lineage. Lineages or time
bins with fewer than 20 sequences were discarded. We
calculated D as described [46]:

on the average number of pairwise differences among

where n is the genome length, N is the number of con-

calculates the number of pairs of consensus sequences
in a set of size N, and Nb_reads_pwdiff is the number of
pairwise nucleotide differences. Because pairwise differ-
ences are maximized when there are intermediate-
frequency
mutations,
θπ
is
more

to
intermediate-frequency mutations. θw is another estima-
tor of the nucleotide diversity which is calculated based
on the number segregating sites and is sensitive to low-

We also estimated dN/dS, the ratio of nonsynonymous

Results and discussion
Sampling and sequencing the first wave in Québec
Our province-wide sequencing effort covers the first
pandemic wave up to June 1st, 2020, with a focus on the
earliest confirmed cases up to April 1st (Fig. 1A). No
particular outbreaks were targeted, in an effort for an
approximately
random
sequencing
of
qPCR-positive
swab
samples
(without
any
cycle
threshold
cutoff;
“Methods”). Consensus sequences of SARS-CoV-2 viral
genomes were obtained by targeted amplification from
clinical nasopharyngeal swabs specimens followed by se-
quencing on Nanopore (n = 180), Illumina (n = 2630),
or MGI (n = 111) platforms. Only sequences passing
quality criteria (less than 5% undetermined bases, “Ns”)
were
considered
for
further
phylogenetic
analyses
(“Methods”; Additional file 2: Table S1). With these gen-
ome sequences, we covered 5.7% of the total number of
reported cases (45,641 laboratory confirmed cases and
5849 suspected cases) up to and including June 1st. To
capture early introduction events, our sequencing effort
was highest (covering 27% of cases) before April 1st, 2
weeks after the Canadian border closed and most repat-
riation of Canadian citizens from abroad had occurred.
Until early April, the mean age of sequenced cases was
approximately 50 years old, then jumped to ~ 75 years
old, likely reflecting that the virus had entered long-term
care facilities (Fig. 1B). By April 1st, over 500 long-term
care facilities had reported at least one case of COVID-

19, and the virus spread steadily through these primarily
elderly populations during the month of April [47].
Inferred SARS-CoV-2 introductions to Québec are mostly
of European origin
Before federally mandated quarantine orders for return-
ing travellers were put in place on March 25th, 1544
travellers who entered Québec had tested positive for
SARS-CoV-2 [17]. However, not all these cases were ne-
cessarily independent introduction events, nor would
they all give rise to successful onward transmission of
SARS-CoV-2. To complement and refine the identifica-
tion of introduction events, we compared self-reported
travel history provided by qPCR-positive COVID-19
cases with a phylogenetic inference of Québec and global
context sequences (n = 15,722 viral genomes from GISA
ID; Additional file 3: Table S2). Following previous
phylogenetic studies of SARS-CoV-2 [2, 5], we used an-
cestral state reconstruction (ASR) to identify non-
Québec to Québec transition nodes in the phylogeny
(Additional file 1: Figure S1 and “Methods”). In this way,
we inferred a total of 615 independent introduction
events based on maximum likelihood (ML) ASR and 579
to 682 introductions based on ACCTRAN and DEL-
TRAN parsimony ASR, respectively (Additional file 1:
Figure S2 and Additional file 4: Table S3). We will refer
to ML ASR results below unless otherwise indicated,
and ranges refer to results of all three methods. In our
preliminary study of 734 Québec sequences up to April
1st, we estimated only 247 introduction events [48], sug-
gesting that introductions are underestimated and are
likely to increase with sample size. Here we report a
sample of genomes 4 times larger than our preliminary
study, but the number of introductions is only 2.5 times
higher, suggesting a plateau in inferred introductions.
We defined Québec transmission lineages as descen-
dants of a unique introduction event in the phylogeny,
and
then
annotated
these
based
upon
Pangolin
(PANGO) [12] and Nextstrain [30] lineage nomencla-
tures. Note that PANGO or Nextstrain are viral phylo-
genetic lineages used for taxonomic purposes, which are
distinct from Québec transmission lineages, which we
define at higher phylogenetic resolution as descendants
of a single introduction event, and thus represent a par-
tially observed transmission chain.
We calculated Tajima’s D as a simple non-parametric
metric of viral effective population size [49] and found
strongly negative values of D early in the epidemic, con-
sistent with exponential growth in mid-March to early
April, followed by decelerating growth as public health
measures likely reduced viral transmission (Fig. 1C). The
decline of Tajima’s D from March 5 to 19 coincides
with, or slightly precedes the increase in the epidemic
curve starting on March 19th, suggesting its utility as an
early indicator of population expansion. For example,
PANGO lineage B.1, which originated in Italy and
spread throughout Europe, showed evidence of rapid
growth in Québec (median D ~ − 2.5 in mid-March)
followed by a decline in late April and May. This is con-
sistent with our observation that B.1 became very com-
mon in Québec by April before being replaced by other
B.1 variants (notably B.1.147 and B.1.350) by the end of
May (Additional file 1: Figure S3).
Of the 2921 Québec consensus sequences analyzed
here, 328 were from COVID-19 cases that had reported
recent travel history. Note that a lack of travel history
could indicate a true lack of travel, or a lack of available
data. Travellers reported returning from the Caribbean
and Latin America (n = 105, 32%, mainly from Mexico,
n = 31, 9.5% and the Dominican Republic, n = 30, 9%),
Europe (n = 104, 32% with the most from France, n =
39, 12% and Spain, n = 20, 6%), and the USA (n = 77,
24%) (Fig. 2A). There was very little reported travel from
Asia (n = 4, 1.2%) and none from China. A moderate
percentage of the phylogenetically inferred introduction
events
(25–28%;
range
across
parsimony
or
ML
methods) were associated with travel history. This is
consistent with travellers being encouraged to get tested,
along with the high sequencing coverage in the early
days of the pandemic in Québec (Fig. 1A). These events
were broadly concordant with travel history, with some
exceptions: notably, Latin America and Europe were ap-
proximately equally popular destinations based on travel
history, but phylogenetic analysis identified Europe as
the more likely origin of introductions into Québec (Fig.
2A, B). This is consistent with European PANGO line-
ages arriving in Québec, perhaps via the Americas—but
before accumulating lineage-defining mutations in the
Americas. The early introductions of PANGO lineages A
and B.4, common in the early outbreaks in China and
Iran respectively, appear not to have been successful in
Québec and were not observed by mid-May (Additional
file 1: Figure S3).
Successful cryptic introductions before the first reported
case are unlikely
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Québec was
detected on February 25th, but phylogenetic analysis has
the potential to infer earlier introduction events. We in-
ferred 15–17 potential introduction events before Febru-
ary 25th, based on their time to the most recent
common ancestor (TMRCA), of which only 5–6 had re-
ported travel history. Throughout, we refer to the
TMRCA of the divergence between a Québec lineage
and its closest non-Québec outgroup (Additional file 1:
Figure S1). The introduction event into Québec must
have happened after the non-QC TMRCA and before
the first sequenced case in QC (Additional file 1: Figure
Murall et al. Genome Medicine          (2021) 13:169 
Page 8 of 17
S1) and thus the earliest possible introduction time
would be the TMRCA. As expected, the TMRCA esti-
mates thus tend to be earlier in time compared to the
sampling dates of returning travellers (Fig. 2C). The
TMRCA estimates are similar among the three ASR
methods applied to the TreeTime phylogeny, but are
consistently later when compared to estimates from
BEAST (Additional file 1: Figure S2). Because BEAST
more thoroughly accounts for phylogenetic uncertainty
than TreeTime, we use the BEAST TMRCA estimates
for detailed analyses of large transmission lineages
below.
The global phylogeny during the first 2 months of
2020 is undersampled, due to sequencing efforts only
beginning to ramp up at that time. This, combined with
relatively slow accumulation of mutations by SARS-
CoV-2, resulted in many large polytomies (unresolved
branchings), making precise inference of introductions
challenging. Indeed, ten of these 15–17 early introduc-
tions are in polytomies and 33–40% are of unclear ori-
gin; thus, their true TMRCA is questionable (Fig. 2C).
For example, the first TMRCAs from Africa/Middle-East
and those of unclear origin are in large polytomies and
thus their true introduction events are likely to be later
than inferred in the time-scaled ML tree (cases marked
with asterisks in Fig. 2C). The earliest reliably dated
introduction has a TMRCA of February 15th, from Eur-
ope
(clustering
with
sequences
from
Switzerland),
followed by an introduction from the UK with a
TRMCA of February 21st. We do not reliably detect any
introductions arriving in January or early February,
which is consistent with a study of samples from pa-
tients with flu-like symptoms between November 2019
to early March that did not find any SARS-CoV-2,

suggesting that introductions before late February are
unlikely (as reported in Le Devoir, September 5th, 2020
[50];) and appear not to have given rise to sustained
transmission.
Most introductions occurred after spring break
To test the hypothesis that spring break travel was a
major source of viral introductions into Québec, we in-
vestigated the Québec transmission lineages with a
TMRCA between Feb. 23rd and March 10th and defined
them as having been plausibly introduced during spring
break. Given that TMRCAs provide an early bound for
transmission into Québec (Additional file 1: Figure S1),
we included introductions with a TMRCA of Feb. 23rd
to account for a lag of up to 6 days from infection to
sampling. During this period, there were 80–100 intro-
duction events (only 12–16% of the total), of which 29–
37 had recorded travel history (~ 37%). The majority of
introductions likely happened after spring break, with
77–83% of TMRCA estimates after March 10th (Fig. 2C
and Additional file 1: Figure S2). The USA is a common
travel destination for Québecers, where many (known as
“snowbirds”) have winter homes. The bulk of the USA
travel-related cases were detected after the border closed
on March 16th, and thus were likely part of the repatri-
ation effort. However, the phylogenetically inferred in-
troductions from the USA suggest that these were not as
successful as the introductions that happened in early
March: the only transmission lineages with > 20 viral ge-
nomes of US origin arrived before March 15th (Fig. 2C).
The majority of the 41–48 introductions from other
Canadian provinces were not reported in travel history
records (38–45 introductions, 93–95%), which is consist-
ent with inter-provincial travel having been common
until being discouraged in late March.
Successful transmission lineages arrived early and spread
widely
Of the total 579–682 independent inferred introduction
events, the majority were singletons (52–63% with only
one observed sequence). Our ~ 5% sequencing coverage
implies that many of these singletons might actually rep-
resent small transmission lineages of around ~ 20 cases
(assuming undersampling is uniform across lineages of
all sizes). Similarly, the 72–76% inferred introductions
that gave rise to small transmission lineages of less than
3 sampled genomes, could each represent transmission
lineages of up to 40 cases. In contrast, only 7–12 intro-
ductions (0.9–1.6% of the total; range of estimates from
parsimony and ML) were successful enough to cause
more than 50 sequenced cases in Québec (Fig. 3), which
implies likely transmission lineages of approximately
1000 cases. The top eight introductions inferred by ML
gave rise to 1544 genomes, or 53% of all sequenced cases
(ASR parsimony range: 7–12 introductions giving rise to
52–75% of all sequenced genomes in the first wave) until
June 1st. This overdispersion is more extreme but
qualitatively similar to a UK study where the eight lar-
gest introductions resulted in > 25% of cases [2]. This
highly overdispersed transmission lineage size distribu-
tion (Fig. 4A) is also similar to what was observed in
Massachusetts [5]. These results are consistent with an
overdispersed reproductive number and suggestive of
superspreading, in which most potential transmission
events are unsuccessful but a minority give rise to
dozens or hundreds of subsequent infections.
Larger transmission lineages tended to be sampled
across more regions in Québec (Fig. 4B), indicating that
the success of these transmission lineages was not due
only to local outbreaks but rather to wide geographic
spread across the province. The PANGO lineages that
spread the most throughout Québec (i.e., being found in
more than ten health regions) were B.1, B.1.5, and
B.1.147 (Additional file 1: Figure S4). Similar to another
study of SARS-CoV-2 in Canada [51], we find that B.1
was by far the most introduced PANGO lineage in Qué-
bec (introduced 216 times, 51% of which were single-
tons). PANGO lineage B.1.147 stayed mostly in the
more populous southern regions of the province while
genomes of B.1 were found in almost all regions (Add-
itional file 1: Figure S4 and Additional file 1: Figure S5).
Lineage B.1.5 first arrived after spring break and was in-
troduced 41 times across Québec but was not successful
at generating transmission lineages of over 12 sampled
genomes and was no longer observed by June 1st (Add-
itional file 1: Figure S3 and Additional file 1: Figure S4).
In contrast, B.1.147 was introduced half as many times
(19 introductions) but these events tended to have oc-
curred earlier in spring break (Fig. 4C and Additional file
1: Figure S3).
The most successful Québec transmission lineages
belonged to B.1.147, B.1.350, B.1.3, and B.1, each of
which was introduced multiple times (Fig. 4C, Add-
itional file 1: Figure S4, Figure S5, and Figure S6). The
prominent spread of B.1.147 and B.1.350 in Québec is
unique compared to the rest of Canada (Additional file
1: Figure S3). In contrast, PANGO A lineages were more
common in British Columbia (consistent with more ini-
tial transmission from Asia) and B.1.1 sublineages in
Ontario [51]. The PANGO lineages common in Québec
(B.1.147, B.1.350, B.1.3, and B.1) had evolutionary rates
comparable to other lineages in Québec (~ 6 × 10−4 sub-
stitutions per site per year; Additional file 1: Figure S7),
somewhat slower but in the range estimated from other
studies [52]. To quantify variation in the strength of nat-
ural selection on these PANGO lineages, we calculated
the nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution ratio
(dN/dS) between all pairs of genomes within a PANGO
Murall et al. Genome Medicine          (2021) 13:169 
Page 10 of 17
lineage (Fig. 4D). Note that this simple estimate of dN/
dS does not account for multiple substitutions at the
same nucleotide site. Over the short evolutionary time
scale considered, we do not expect this to significantly
affect the results. There was a modest positive correl-
ation between a PANGO lineage’s dN/dS and its average
transmission lineage size (Pearson’s R2 = 0.12, permuta-
tion test P = 0.0002). Much of this correlation is driven
by lineage B.1.147 (Fig. 4C, D) and could be explained
by the accumulation of low-frequency, slightly deleteri-
ous nonsynonymous mutations at the tips of a rapidly
expanding clade [53, 54], which is also consistent with
strongly negative Tajima’s D values (Fig. 1C). Together,
these results suggest rapid population growth of the
most successful PANGO lineages.
The 7–12 largest transmission lineages likely arrived
relatively early (all TMRCA 95% HPD before or dur-
ing spring break) and were still detectable in late May
(Fig. 5). The median effective reproductive numbers
(Re, estimated by phylodynamic analysis) for 10 of the
12 largest transmission lineages were estimated in the
range of 2–3, consistent with exponential growth (Fig.
5). Two transmission lineages by B.1 and B.1.3 had
higher Re values, potentially due to their rapid spread
in long-term care facilities. Although our dataset lacks
explicitly defined outbreaks in care facilities or else-
where, we used the following criteria to identify likely
care facility outbreaks caused by large transmission
lineages (with at least 20 sequenced cases): a mono-
phyletic group of three or more seniors (at least 60
years old), similar date of sampling (within 5 days),
and identical Québec health region. We counted an
average of 1.5 possible care facility outbreaks per
large transmission lineage (SD 1.6, range 0–6). This
suggests that, even if our sampling did not directly
target these outbreaks, they are well-represented in

the dataset. The B.1 transmission lineage that spread
mostly in a care facility in the city of Laval [55], is a
particularly striking example, where the median age
jumped to 83 years old (IQR 71 to 89 years) after a
likely introduction by a person in their forties (Add-
itional file 1: Figure S8). This outbreak was brought
under control, and no sequences were detected past
early May (Fig. 5; Additional file 1: Figure S8).
The self-isolation mandates for arriving travellers
(Québec’s orders on March 11th and federal mandatory
quarantine orders on March 25th) appear to have been
effective, such that there were more larger transmission
lineage sizes that started before March 11th than after
March 11th (skewness of the lineage size frequency dis-
tribution pre-March 11th = 6.25 vs skewness post-
March 11th = 9.42; pre-March 11th range = [1, 452],
post-March 11th range [1, 105]). After the federal quar-
antine orders, 70% of introductions were singletons and
only four gave rise to 10 or more sampled genomes. The
TMRCA of the last introduction event inferred in our
dataset was April 16th, 2020.
Mutation and founder effects on transmission lineage size
Finally, we considered the extent to which the success
of an introduction event could be explained by founder
effects or adaptive mutations. To investigate the role of
specific mutations, we defined nine lineage-specific sin-
gle nucleotide variants (alleles) present in all members
of each PANGO lineage and tested their associations
with transmission lineage size. We found that mutation
D614G
in
the
Spike
protein
(genome
position
A23403G) was present in all ten of the most successful
introduction events into Québec (Additional file 1: Fig-
ure S9) and generally dominated our sampled se-
quences
(Fig.
6A).
Independent
introductions
of
PANGO lineages with the derived G allele gave rise to
a mean transmission lineage size of 6.6 cases, compared
to 3.4 for the ancestral D allele; however, this difference
is not statistically significant (Additional file 1: Figure
S9). In contrast, derived nonsynonymous mutations in
three consecutive nucleotide sites (28881-28883) span-
ning two codons in the nucleocapsid (N) protein were
significantly
associated
with
smaller
transmission
lineage size (Additional file 1: Figure S9) and were less
represented in our sequences (Fig. 6A).
If founder effects also played a role in determining
successful transmission, we would expect the earliest
introduction events to give rise to larger transmission
lineages. Consistent with founder effects, we observed a
significant negative correlation between inferred arrival
time and transmission lineage size (Fig. 6B). This nega-
tive correlation was also observed using alternative ASR
methods (Additional file 1: Figure S10). We also note
that most of the early, successful introduction events
had no reported travel history, highlighting the import-
ance of phylogenetic analysis in identifying them. There-
fore,
while
we
cannot
exclude
a
role
of
specific
mutations affecting transmission, lineage success in
Québec’s first pandemic wave can most parsimoniously
be explained by a combination of founder effects and ef-
fective public health measures.

Conclusions
Québec is unique among Canadian provinces for its early
spring break, which resulted in many returning travellers
before border closures and quarantine measures were
enacted. Mathematical modelling results [17] suggest that
Québec’s large SARS-CoV-2 first wave was, in part, driven
by an early spring break. Here we show that earlier intro-
duction events were much more likely to give rise to sus-
tained transmission, compared to less successful later
arrivals. Even though most introduction events were in-
ferred after spring break, those that arrived before or dur-
ing spring break generated the largest transmission
lineages. Before quarantine and other public health mea-
sures were in place, eight introductions that arrived during
spring break gave rise to hundreds of subsequent infec-
tions and spread widely across Québec. While hundreds
of introduction events continued to occur after spring
break, these spread much less widely, likely due to effect-
ive public health measures. This scenario closely mirrors
the early SARS-CoV-2 introductions into the UK, which
also spread widely and proved hard to eliminate [2].
Our phylogenetic analysis is generally concordant with
self-reported travel history, but also revealed a large
number of introduced European SARS-CoV-2 PANGO
lineages that were not apparent from travel history. Qué-
bec is, thus, similar to other East Coast North American
epidemics, such as Boston [5] and New York [56], that
were primarily seeded by European lineages, in contrast
to more Asian lineages on the West Coast [8, 51]. The
Québec sequences were distributed broadly across the
global phylogenetic tree, representing most of the known
diversity,
with
an
under-representation
of
early-
branching Asian lineages. Like other phylogenetic stud-
ies, ours is limited by sampling: we cannot reliably detect
introduction events from countries poorly represented
in public databases, nor have we sequenced all SARS-
CoV-2 infections in Québec. We were able to sequence
~ 6% of positive cases, putting our effort nearly on par
with other leading genomic surveillance projects (e.g., ~
8% in the UK as of spring 2021; https://www.
cogconsortium.uk/). Nevertheless, our estimate of ap-
proximately 600 independent introduction events is

almost certainly an underestimate. This highlights the
need for sustained genomic surveillance efforts.
Although it is notoriously difficult to disentangle
demographic factors from fitness effects of viral muta-
tions [57], our results are consistent with a mild (not
statistically significant) transmission advantage of the
D614G Spike mutation, as observed elsewhere [10]. We
also identified three adjacent derived mutations in the N
protein associated with smaller transmission lineage size.
These mutations (nucleotide positions 28881-28883)
have been reported before, but their functional signifi-
cance remains unclear [58] and could warrant further
study. While these mutations may have played some role
in affecting transmission in Québec, the differential suc-
cess of introduced lineages is parsimoniously explained
by founder effects, such that the first PANGO lineages
that arrived tended to be successful. The recent success
of lineage B.1.1.7 (alpha variant), which spread in the
UK and elsewhere despite competition from previously
established PANGO lineages, cannot be easily explained

positions correspond to the following amino positions in genes: A23403G;D614G;S;S, C1059T;T85I;orf1a;NSP2, C11916T;S25L;orf1a;NSP7, C14408T;P323L;orf1b;NSP12,
C15324T;N629N;orf1b;NSP12, C3037T;F107F;orf1a;NSP3, G28881A;R203K;N;N, G28882A;R203R;N;N, G28883C;G204R;N;N. Nucleotide positions are coded as follows:
ancestral nucleotide allele, genome position, derived nucleotide allele; ancestral amino acid allele, position in protein, derived amino acid allele; ORF; gene. B
Introductions that generated transmission lineages of > 2 genomes as a function of the TMRCA (inferred by ML ASR), colored by PANGO lineage name and
annotated if the introduction had reported travel history (y) or not (n). Pearson correlation coefficients: r = − 0.30 (− 0.43, − 0.16), p = 6.828e−05, black line. Note
that the last inferred introduction event had a TMRCA of April 16th, not shown here because it was a singleton

by founder effects [13]. Nevertheless, founder effects and
other demographic factors must be carefully considered
when inferring a transmission advantage of PANGO
lineage of interest.
We observed an overdispersed distribution of intro-
duced
transmission
lineage
size:
most
introduction
events went extinct, while only 7–12 introductions (<
2%) gave rise to at least one third of sequenced cases.
Although we did not directly document specific super-
spreading
events,
the
overdispersed
distribution
of
lineage sizes is consistent with superspreading dynamics,
as documented previously using genomic epidemiology
[5]. Viral lineages that were introduced after the self-
isolation mandate for travellers were largely unsuccessful
at generating large transmission lineages, despite re-
peated
introductions
into
Québec.
Although
our
province-wide sampling was not designed to focus on
specific outbreaks, they are reflected in our dataset. For
example, one introduction of viral lineage B.1 during
spring break quickly spread from younger to older indi-
viduals in a long-term care facility. This example mirrors
the broader trajectory of the Québec epidemic in the
first pandemic wave. Our study demonstrates the im-
portance of timely public health actions during the early
phases of a pandemic and how they shape the dynamics,
size, and geographical spread of a novel pathogen.

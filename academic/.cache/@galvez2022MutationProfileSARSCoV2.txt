The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiopathogenic agent of COVID- 
19, a condition that has led to a formally recognized pandemic by March 2020 (World Health Organization 
–WHO). The SARS-CoV-2 genome is constituted of 29,903 base pairs, that code for four structural proteins (N, M, 
S, and E) and more than 20 non-structural proteins. Mutations in any of these regions, especially in those that 
encode for the structural proteins, have allowed the identification of diverse lineages around the world, some of 
them named as Variants of Concern (VOC) and Variants of Interest (VOI), according to the WHO and CDC. In this 
study, by using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology, we sequenced the SARS-CoV-2 genome of 422 
samples from Colombian residents, all of them collected between April 2020 and January 2021. We obtained 
genetic information from 386 samples, leading us to the identification of 14 new lineages circulating in 
Colombia, 13 of which were identified for the first time in South America. GH was the predominant GISAID clade 
in our sample. Most mutations were either missense (53.6%) or synonymous mutations (37.4%), and most ge-
netic changes were located in the ORF1ab gene (63.9%), followed by the S gene (12.9%). In the latter, we 
identified mutations E484K, L18F, and D614G. Recent evidence suggests that these mutations concede important 
particularities to the virus, compromising host immunity, the diagnostic test performance, and the effectiveness 
of some vaccines. Some important lineages containing these mutations are the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma (WHO 
Label). Further genomic surveillance is important for the understanding of emerging genomic variants and their 
correlation with disease severity.   
1. Introduction 
In December 2019 a disease outbreak that caused respiratory failure 
in Wuhan, China, eventually developed into a global pandemic. The 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was 
identified as the etiopathogenic agent of the respiratory disease called 
COVID-19, which after 2 months of its appearance, had already been 
established around the world (Sharma et al., 2020). On January 30, 
2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health 
emergency of international concern. By June 5, 2021, 172,712,949 
confirmed cases and 3,716,918 deaths had been reported in more than 
221 countries worldwide. In Colombia, by the same date 3,518,046 
confirmed cases and 90,890 deaths had been reported, being the third 
most affected country in Latin America and 12th worldwide. By the 
moment of the submission of this manuscript, Colombia has faced three 
COVID-19 waves (July–August 2020; January 2021; and April 2021-pre-
sent) (COVID-19 Map, 2021; Sharma et al., 2020). 
The impact on health and the world economy associated with the 
emergence of this virus has generated interest in understanding its 
origin, spread, and evolution in a genomic path. Generation and analysis

of virus genomic data has been a key component of this research and 
promises to provide critical insights into the emergence and spread of 
SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 Map, 2021). 
The analysis of genomic data allowed to identify that the virus be-
longs to the beta-coronavirus 2b lineage. The SARS-CoV-2 genome 
consists of a positive polarity single-stranded RNA (+ ssRNA) of 29,903 
base pairs. This RNA chain structurally resembles messenger RNA 
(mRNA) of eukaryotic cells, since it has a methylated cap (cap) at the 5′
end and a polyadenylated tail (poly-A) at the 3′ end. However, unlike 
eukaryotic mRNAs, this viral genome contains at least six open reading 
frames (ORFs) (Pastrian-Soto, 2020; Sharma et al., 2020; van Dorp et al., 
2020). 
Currently, the mechanisms underlying the variation in clinical sus-
ceptibility to COVID-19 and the disease presentation are yet to be fully 
characterized, raising doubts as to the importance of viral and host ge-
netic mutations as likely factors that influence both disease severity and 
individual immune response (Pastrian-Soto, 2020; van Dorp et al., 
2020). Viral and host genetic studies are essential to understand the 
pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 and inform the basis for the design of 
new vaccines and antiviral therapies. Additionally, such studies can help 
determine whether emerging viral strains are related to more severe 
clinical outcomes or whether individuals harboring certain alleles are 
susceptible to disease (Ovsyannikova et al., 2020; Pastrian-Soto, 2020; 
Sharma et al., 2020; van Dorp et al., 2020). 
In December 2020, evidence began to emerge that a novel SARS- 
CoV-2 variant, Variant of Concern 202012/01 (lineage B.1.1.7, hence-
forth VOC 202012/01, and later named Alpha), was rapidly out-
competing preexisting variants in southeast England. Its incidence rose 
during a national lockdown in November 2020, in response to a previous 
and unrelated surge in COVID-19 cases, and continued to spread 
following the lockdown despite ongoing restrictions in many of the most 
affected areas. Concern over this variant led the UK government to enact 
stronger restrictions in these regions on December 20, 2020, and even-
tually to impose a third national lockdown on January 5, 2021. As of 
February 15, 2021, lineage Alpha comprised roughly 95% of new SARS- 
CoV-2 infections in England and has now been identified in at least 82 
countries (Davies et al., 2021). There have been other strains identified 
in different countries, including South Africa, namely variant 501Y.V2, 
later termed Beta, likely emerging from the first wave of COVID-19 back 
in May 2020. The Beta strain has been found by now in several countries 
and is considered to be more transmissible (Ramanathan et al., 2021). In 
addition, the P.1 (20J/501Y.V3, labeled as Gamma) variant is a strain 
that was found in Manaus, Brazil, which generated international 
apprehension due to its high transmissibility (de Souza et al., 2021; Tang 
et al., 2021). 
The global and uncontrolled scale of this pandemic created a sce-
nario where genomic epidemiology was put into practice en masse, from 
the rapid sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 to the identification of new lineages 
by means of active surveillance throughout the world. Prior to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, the availability of genomic data on circulating 
pathogens in several Latin American and Caribbean countries was scarce 
or nil (´Alvarez-Díaz et al., 2020). With the arrival of SARS-CoV-2, this 
scenario slightly changed, although available information remains 
scarce and, in countries such as Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, and Chile, 
genomic information of SARS-CoV-2 is obtained mainly by research 
groups in genomic epidemiology rather than by public health surveil-
lance policy or programs. This indicates the need to reinforce public 
health policies aimed at implementing genomic epidemiology as a tool 
to strengthen surveillance and early warning systems against threats to 
public health in the region (´Alvarez-Díaz et al., 2020; Islam et al., 2020). 
In this study we aimed to describe the genomic sequence obtained 
from 422 Colombian resident patients diagnosed in Bogot´a and Cali, 
between April 2020 and January of 2021, carrying out a molecular 
epidemiological characterization, and describing the frequency of ge-
netic mutations. 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Sampling and nucleic acid inactivation and extraction 
Nasopharyngeal swab / aspirate samples were obtained from pa-
tients confirmed to have COVID-19 in two participating tertiary care 
hospitals and a molecular diagnosis laboratory located in two main cities 
in Colombia. 
Prospective samples were evaluated by RT-PCR to detect SARS-CoV- 
2 presence; alternatively, SARS-CoV-2 antigen positive tests were per-
formed followed by a nasopharyngeal swab/ aspirate for confirmation 
by RT-PCR, within 72 h. RT-PCR negative samples were discharged and 
those patients were not included in the study. Retrospective specimen 
collection nasopharyngeal RT-PCR positive samples, either RNA eluate 
or primary swab/ aspirate samples, were also obtained. 
Automated RNA extraction was performed using either the Exi-
Prep™ 96 Viral DNA/RNA Kit, on ExiPrep™ 96 Lite instrument (Bioneer 
Corp., Daejeon, Republic of Korea), the MGIEasy Nucleic Acid Extrac-
tion Kit on the MGISP-960 (MGI Tech Co. Ltd., Shenzhen, PRC), the 
NucliSENS® Nucleic Acid Extraction Reagents on NucliSENS® easy-
MAG® (bioM´erieux SA, Marcy l’Etoile, France), or MagNA Pure® 
Compact Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I on MagNA Pure® Compact (Roche 
Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). 
For RNA extraction, a 200 μL aliquot of viral transport media con-
taining the primary swab sample, or a 1000 μL aliquot in sterile saline 
isotonic solution in case of primary aspirate sample, was inactivated by 
exposure to 56 ◦C for 30 min, in a class II, type B2 biosafety cabinet. 
Inactivated samples were transferred to any of the above described 
automated RNA extraction instruments. Briefly, RNA automated 
extraction consists of cell lysis, followed by bead binding to the magnetic 
rods, RNA binding to the beads, washing, and finally, RNA elution, 
obtaining approximately 100 μL of RNA (Kessler et al., 2001; Petrich 
et al., 2006). 
2.2. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing 
Whole-genome amplification of the SARS-CoV-2 was performed 
using the CleanPlex® for MGI SARS-CoV-2 Panel (Paragon Genomics 
Inc., Hayward, CA, USA). Briefly, cDNA was generated from previously 
extracted RNA followed by purification from purified RNA samples. 
Then, a multiplex PCR reaction using target-specific primers to amplify 
the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome was performed, using a 2-pool design, 
followed by a second PCR reaction to amplify and add sample-level in-
dexes to the generated libraries. This second PCR introduced an indexed 
PCR primer for the specific sequencer. Finally, the library was purified 
using CleanMag® Magnetic Beads (Paragon Genomics Inc.) (Li et al., 
2020). Libraries were considered for sequencing when a fragment size 
between 170 and 300 bp was obtained and the final concentration was 
above 2.0 ng/μl, measured by a fluorometric method Quantus® 
(Promega Corp., Fitchburg, WI, USA). 
In order to be sequenced, libraries were converted to DNBs (DNA 
nanoballs). DNBs are generated by Rolling Circle Replication (RCR/ 
RCA), a process that includes primer annealing, extension, displacement 
of DNA strand and continued extension, always from the original tem-
plate, which allows avoiding error accumulation and low amplification 
bias. Then, circularized libraries were sequenced using either a DNBSeq- 
G50RS or a DNBSeq-G400RS sequencer (MGI Tech Co. Ltd., Shenzhen, 
PRC). These instruments use DNBSEQ™ technology consisting of DNBs 
pumping and loaded onto an array chip by the fluidics system. 
Sequencing primer is then added and hybridized to the adaptor region of 
the DNB. The sequencing reaction starts by pumping sequencing re-
agents containing fluorescently labeled dNTP probes and DNA poly-
merase. Images are taken after the fluorescently labeled probes on the 
DNB are excited with lasers. The images are then converted into a digital 
signal. This information is then used to determine the DNA sequence of 
the sample (Drmanac et al., 2010).

Reference-based genome assembly and sequence analysis were per-
formed using SOPHiA DDM software for SARS-CoV-2 (SOPHiA Genetics 
Inc., Boston, MA, USA). Paired-end reads were aligned to the reference 
SARS-CoV-2 genome (NC_045512.2) using bwa mem (version 0.7.12- 
r1039) (2) and the following command: bwa mem -M reference.fasta 
read1.fastq read2.fastq. Aligned reads underwent adaptor trimming by 
removing all read 3′ bases extending beyond the 5′ starting position of its 
paired-end mate. Read alignment was inspected to identify and remove 
amplicons where at least one primer aligned to an unexpected genomic 
position (mispriming events). Mispriming events include any softclipped 
sequence longer than 10 bp matching another primer sequence better 
than the sequence at the current position. The remaining softclipped 
read fragments longer than 10 bp were aligned to the genome in the 
closest vicinity (up to a distance of 400 bp) to the read mapped position 
to detect putative insertions or deletions. Smith–Waterman alignment 
score was calculated with the following penalty scores: base match: +1, 
base mismatch: −1, gap open: −2, gap extend: −1. If the fragment 
aligned to the alternative location with a score of ≥10, the softclipped 
part of the read was flagged as part of an indel. Finally, sequences 
overlapping primer positions were trimmed, if found at most 5 bp from 
the beginning or end of the read. Read fragments shorter than 21 bp 
were discarded from the final alignment 
A pileup file was generated from the final post-processed alignment 
and only base pairs with a Phred score higher than 20 were considered. 
To prevent miscalls due to background noise, at each genomic position a 
one-sided Fisher’s test was performed on a 2 × 2 matrix containing (i) 
the average number of reads with reference alleles calculated at each 
covered genomic position, (ii) the number of reads with reference alleles 
at current position, (iii) the average number of reads with alternative 
alleles calculated at each genomic position, (iv) the number of reads 
with alternative alleles at current position. If the test p-value was higher 
than 10−5 the mutation was not reported at the position tested. 
Miscalls due to strand-biased detection were removed in a similar 
way. Fisher’s test was used to analyze the proportion of reads supporting 
the alternative or reference allele derived from either the plus and minus 
strands. If the test p-value was lower than 10−7 the mutation was filtered 
out as strand-biased. 
The minimal total read coverage considered for mutation reporting 
was 10 reads while the minimal read coverage supporting a mutation 
was 3 reads. Nucleotide substitutions at first position of the amplicon 
were not reported unless they were also detected in adjacent, over-
lapping amplicons (Kubik et al., 2021). 
2.3. Phylogenetic analysis 
All SARS-CoV-2 genomes were downloaded from SOPHiA™ DDM® 
bioinformatics software (SOPHiA Genetics Inc.). We aligned these se-
quences along the reference genome, NC_045512, using MAFFT v7 
software (Katoh et al., 2002). Then, the mutation was estimated using 
jMoldelTest v2.1.10 model (Posada, 2008). Then, a maximum likelihood 
tree was constructed using IQ-TREE 2 (Minh et al., 2020) and the GTR +
Γ model, using 1000 bootstrap replicates. Finally, each sample had a 
lineage assigned using PANGOLIN’s web server (Rambaut et al., 2020) 
and the online version of CoVsurver (CoVsurver - CoronaVirus Surveil-
lance Server, 2021) was used for GISAID clade assignation of the 
samples. 
Samples analyzed were obtained from participants that accepted and 
consented to participate in the study. The research project was approved 
by the IRB of Universidad del Rosario and the participant hospitals in 
Colombia, and it accomplished all the international and national 
bioethical principles and regulations for research in human subjects. 
2.4. Statistical analysis 
To synthesize demographic characteristics of the sample we present 
descriptive statistics. We used absolute and relative frequencies for 
categorical variables. For quantitative data, we present median and 
interquartile range. We used R v 4.0.2 software for statistical analysis. 
3. Results 
To inform our findings we used the terminology proposed in outb 
reak.info, an open-data source supported by the National Institutes of 
Health (NIH) and Center for Data to Health (CD2H). Briefly, a mutation 
is an error in viral genome established during replication. A variant is an 
aggregation of several mutations in a single genome. A lineage refers to 
“the descendants of a branch of a phylogenetic tree”. Finally, a strain is a 
viral genome with differential phenotypic characteristics and implicates 
a specific immune response by the hostage (Outbreak.Info, 2021). 
We recruited 422 Colombian resident patients with RT-PCR 
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection whose symptom onset ranged from 
April 2020 to January 2021. Sociodemographic characteristics from the 
386 patients whose samples were included in the genetic analysis 
showed that 53.5% were male and the median age was 45.7 years 
(31.6–62.5). The geographic origin of the sequences was 73.2% from 
Bogot´a and 26.8% from Cali, Colombia. Around half of the patients 
(40.9%) received in-hospital attention, the others were ambulatory. 
3.1. Sequenced SARS-CoV-2 specimens 
From the 422 samples, we were able to obtain genetic data from 386 
cases. Variation analysis of these 386 sequences revealed 1716 muta-
tions detected across the length of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Most mu-
tations were either missense (53.6%) or synonymous (37.4%). Loss-of- 
function (LoF) mutations were rare; only 26 (1.51%) nonsense and 47 
(2.73%) frameshift mutations were identified. Most of the genetic 
changes found (63.9%) were located in the ORF1ab gene, followed by 
the S gene (12.9%), whereas the ORF10 had the lowest number of 
changes (0.64%). Nevertheless, when corrected by gene length, the 
mutation rate per kb was higher in ORF8 (202.07 mutations per kb), 
followed by N (115.64 mutations per kb), while the lowest rate was 
found in the ORF1ab gene (51.48 mutations per kb) (Table 1). 
Additionally, we found four recurrent mutations which have been 
previously described as hotspots since they have a frequency higher than 
0.10 in the population. We identified Q57H on ORF3a in 184 out of 386 
(47.6%) samples; we also found and R203K, R203R, G204R on N gene, 
in 74 (19.1%), 72 (18.7%), and 72 (18.7%) out of 386 cases, 
respectively. 
Active domains of each SARS-CoV-2 protein with well-established 
function and their respective amino acid lengths were characterized 
using the bioinformatics tool UniProt. All missense and LoF mutations 
that compromise some of these domains were deeply analyzed hypoth-
esizing that mutations in these regions will impact the biological pro-
cesses of the virus. Important for the characterization and identification 
of new lineages with potential for increased transmissibility and/or 
lethality, also known as variants of concern (VOC) or variants of interest 
(VOI), we identified on the spike glycoprotein 223 mutations, from 
which 135 were missense (60.53%), 82 synonymous (36.77%), 5 
frameshift (2.24%) and 1 (0.44%) intergenic. Also, we identified 10 
mutations within the aminoacidic residues 319 and 541, which consti-
tute the receptor-binding domain (RBD). 
The mutations p.Lys1191Asp (K1191D), p.Glu484Lys (E484K), p. 
Leu18Phe (L18F), p.Pro26Ser (P26S), p.His655Tyr (H655Y), p. 
Asp614Gly (D614G), that along with other nucleotide substitutions 
constitute some of the VOC and VOI, were also identified, but not 
necessarily defining a complete lineage of interest. The spike glyco-
protein mutation D614G was found in the totality of the sequences ob-
tained (Table 2). 
3.2. Phylogenetic analysis 
The maximum likelihood tree inferred for the 386 samples revealed a

topology of two major genetic groups (Fig. 1), with one sample not 
included in these groups because it is closely related to the original 
Wuhan strain. The remaining samples were clustered into two different 
branches: The first one comprises 186 samples, the second one clus-
tering 194 samples. The remaining five samples failed the chi-square test 
performed by Iqtree and therefore, they aren’t present on the tree. 
However, this particular topology should be interpreted carefully, given 
the low bootstrap values (not shown) due to aligning sequences with 
high similarity percentages. 
We identified 30 different PANGO lineages. The most frequent 
lineage was B.1 followed by B.1.111 and B.1.1.348 (Table 3). The dis-
tribution of PANGO lineages by sampling date is shown in Fig. 2. 
The GH GISAID clade was the most frequent (n = 167; 43.3%), fol-
lowed by the G clade (n = 122; 31.6%) and GR clade (n = 66; 17.1%); 31 
(8.0%) samples were classified as other. 
4. Discussion 
Hereby we inform 30 PANGO lineages found in 386 SARS-CoV-2 
sequences, including 14 newly reported PANGO lineages circulating in 
Colombia, 13 of which are also newly reported in South America as 
reviewed by June 5, 2021 (https://github.com/cov-lineages/pangolin). 
According to GISAID data, as of January 2021, GR was the most 
common clade worldwide, followed by GV and GH. On our sample, the 
GH clade was predominant, followed by the G and GR clades, similar to 
what has been described for North America. Interestingly, this distri-
bution differs from what has been described for South America. This is 
probably due to the larger contribution of sequences from Brazil, where 
the P.1 VOC, part of the GR clade, has become predominant (Hamed 
et al., 2021). 
The frequency of the most predominant PANGO lineages identified 
here is consistent with the data of the 1085 sequences reported by the 
National Institute of Health in Colombia by May 21st of 2021 (Coro-
navirus Colombia, 2021). B.1 and B.1.111 lineages represent 55.4%, 
confirming them as the first and second most frequent lineages identi-
fied in Colombia. By February 2021 the B.1.111 lineage in GISAID had a 
significant representation in samples from Colombia. Recently, new 
evidence from Colombian National Institute of Health, has shown that 
the mutation E484K is becoming associated with this lineage. In our 
study we found the E484K mutation in a single sample taken in 
December 2020 from a case with the B.1 lineage, parental lineage of 
B.1.111 (Laiton-Donato et al., 2021). 
The finding of E484K is relevant since this mutation has been 
described in several VOC and VOI, which WHO labeled as Alpha, Beta, 
Eta, Gamma, and Iota. According to the literature, single amino acid 
mutations in the viral Spike glycoprotein, could modulate ACE2 binding, 
alter B-cell epitopes to promote immune escape or render monoclonal 
antibodies ineffective (Pastrian-Soto, 2020; van Dorp et al., 2020). For 
example, the mutation in the 484 amino acid of the S glycoprotein, being 
part of the binding domain to the ACE2 human receptor, could have 
important implications related to the severity of the disease (Ram-
anathan et al., 2021). Recent studies have found in vitro evidence that 
the presence of this mutation is associated with a reduction in the ac-
tivity of monoclonal antibodies and convalescent serum authorized for 
COVID-19 emergency use (Huang and Wang, 2021; Jangra et al., 2021). 
Interestingly we found other 10 mutations within the aminoacidic res-
idues 319 and 541, which constitute the RBD that should be followed 
within the genomic surveillance program stablished by the country. 
According to several studies, the L18F mutation, also located in the S 
glycoprotein and present in 16 of our samples, apparently gives a 
replicative advantage to the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma lineages. Pre-
liminary evidence suggests that this mutation is associated with a 
decreased immunological response because it compromises suscepti-
bility of the RBD to neutralizing antibodies (Cele et al., 2021; Grabowski 
et al., 2021). 
All of our samples contain the Spike glycoprotein mutation D614G. 
This nucleotide substitution (Laiton-Donato et al., 2021) rapidly turned 
into a worldwide prevalent mutation. Nevertheless, despite its high

speed of transmission, recent evidence demonstrated that this amino 
acidic change on its own, is not associated with a particular phenotype 
(Grubaugh et al., 2020; Isabel et al., 2020). 
Mutations are an important mechanism for evolution, fitness, and 
survival of viruses, and SARS-CoV-2 is a virus still adapting to humans. A 
mutation rate of 9.9 × 10–4 to 2.2 × 10–3 nucleotides/genome per year 
for SARS-CoV-2 has been estimated, according to L. V´azquez-Sirvent, B. 
Martínez-Gonz´alez, M.E. Soria, and C. Perales, unpublished results, 
which is similar to other active RNA viruses (Domingo et al., 2021). In 
this study we described the genetic changes in our SARS-CoV-2 samples. 
We found that missense and synonymous mutations were the most 
prevalent genetic variations, similar to previous reports (Chan et al., 
2020a; Wang et al., 2020). As expected, LoF, loss of start, and loss of stop 
mutations are the least frequent changes. Interestingly, we found several 
LoF mutations (both nonsense and frameshift) as well as a loss of initi-
ation codon mutation that compromises the functional domains of the 
ORF8 protein, even when corrected for mutations per kb (Supplemen-
tary Material Table 1). It has been hypothesized that ORF8 may play a 
role in modulating host immune response by blocking host IL-17 
cytokine by its interaction with host IL17RA (Chan et al., 2020b). 
Therefore, it would be interesting to study the host immune response 
when LoF mutations in the ORF8 gene are present. 
In relation to genetic variation among SARS-CoV-2 genes, similar to 
previous reports, we found that ORF1ab and S genes have the highest 
number of mutations (Chan et al., 2020a; Wen et al., 2020). ORF10, 
previously reported as highly conserved, presented a low number of 
mutations (the lowest in our sample, with a total of 11 genetic varia-
tions) (Tsai et al., 2020). When corrected for mutations per kb, ORF8 and 
N genes had the highest rate of mutations (202,1 and 115,6 mutations 
per kb, respectively), while S and ORF1ab genes had the lowest (58,3 
and 51,5 mutations per kb, respectively). ORF8 has been described as 
one of the most hypervariable and rapidly evolving genes of SARS-CoV- 
2, explaining its high mutation rate (Alkhansa et al., 2021; Zinzula, 
2021). 
Several hotspot mutations have been described in different regions of 
the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Of those, we reported here the following four: 
Q57H on ORF3a, and R203K, R203R, G204R on N gene. Three of them, 
R203K, R203R, and G204R, co-existed in 72 samples, similar to previous

quences and revealing two main genetic clusters.

reports around the world, suggesting a linkage disequilibrium, which 
makes functional inferences difficult (Laamarti et al., 2020; Ogawa 
et al., 2020). 
The frequency of Q57H hotspot mutation on ORF3a has been rated 
among the top three in the United States (top six around the world). 
Additionally, R203K is within the top five in the United States (top three 
in the world); G204R ranks in the top six in the United States (top four in 
the world)(Wang et al., 2021). 
The ORF3a protein is the largest accessory protein in the SARS-CoV-2 
genome: it is expressed in intracellular and plasma membranes, inducing 
apoptosis and inflammatory response in the infected cells. Q57H mu-
tation makes the protein unstable, altering apoptosis and, as a result, 
increasing the viral load in the host cell (Ren et al., 2020; Wang et al., 
2021). 
N gene codifies for the nucleocapsid protein, which plays a key role 
in RNA packaging and the release of viral particles (Zeng et al., 2020). 
The amino acid positions 203 and 204 are highly conserved among other 
coronaviruses. As previously described, R203K mutation may not affect 
protein function. However, mutation G204R seems to alter protein 
folding and eventually lead to a functional impact (R. Wang et al., 2021). 
Even though South America has been severely affected by the 
COVID-19 pandemic, the amount of genetic sequences available from 
the region is still scarce. The present sample represents a contribution to 
the genomic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 in Colombia, the 12th 
affected country worldwide, in terms of an absolute number of cases 
with 3,593,016 cases and the 20th worldwide (5th in South America) in 
relation to mortality rate per 100,000 by June 7, 2021. Additionally, this 
study comprises the first ten months of the COVID-19 pandemic in 
Colombia and involves the first two waves, which allows a modest 
approach to the virus genetic characterization through the study 
interval. 
The study has some limitations: it only includes samples from two 
main cities in Colombia, including the capital city, leading to an un-
derrepresentation of other regions in the country. Also, due to the 
descriptive nature of the study, it does not evaluate the functional 
impact of the mutations described. 
5. Conclusions 
In conclusion, we identified 14 new lineages in Colombia, 13 of 
which are newly reported in South America. Additionally, similar to 
previous reports, we found that missense and synonymous mutations are 
the most frequent, and ORF1ab and S genes have the highest number of 
mutations. Also, we found important mutations such as E484K, L18F, 
and D614G, which impact on viral transmissibility, host immunity, and 
disease severity.

here are currently more than 35,000 publicly available com-
plete or near-complete genome sequences of severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (as of 
1 June 2020) and the number continues to grow. This remarkable 
achievement has been made possible by the rapid genome sequenc-
ing and online sharing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes by public health 
and research teams worldwide. These genomes have the potential 
to provide invaluable insights into the ongoing evolution and epi-
demiology of the virus during the pandemic and will likely play an 
important role in surveillance and its eventual mitigation and con-
trol. Despite such a wealth of data, there is currently no coherent 
system for naming and discussing the growing number of phyloge-
netic lineages that comprise the population diversity of this virus, 
with conflicting ad hoc and informal systems of virus nomencla-
ture in circulation. A nomenclature system for the genetic diversity 
of SARS-CoV-2 (a clade within the family Coronaviridae, genus 
Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus, species Severe acute respi-
ratory syndrome-related virus1) is urgently required before the scien-
tific literature and communication become further confused.
There is no universal approach to classifying virus genetic diver-
sity below the level of a virus species2 and this is not covered by the 
International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Typically, genetic 
diversity is categorized into distinct ‘clades’, each corresponding to 
a monophyletic group on a phylogenetic tree. These clades may 
be referred to by a variety of terms, such as ‘subtypes’, ‘genotypes’, 
‘groups’, depending on the taxonomic level under investigation or 
the established scientific literature for the virus in question. The 
clades usually reflect an attempt to divide pathogen phylogeny 
and genetic diversity into a set of groupings that are approximately 
equally divergent, mutually exclusive and statistically well sup-
ported. Therefore, all genome sequences are allocated to one clade or 
provisionally labelled as ‘unclassified’. Often, multiple hierarchical  
levels of classification exist for the same pathogens, such as the 
terms ‘type’, ‘group’ and ‘subtype’ that are used in the field of human 
immunodeficiency virus research.
Such classification systems are useful for discussing epidemi-
ology and transmission when the number of taxonomic labels is 
roughly constant through time; this is the case for slowly evolv-
ing pathogens (for example, many bacteria) and for rapidly evolv-
ing viruses with low rates of lineage turnover (for example, human 
immunodeficiency virus3 and hepatitis C virus4). In contrast, some 
rapidly evolving viruses such as influenza A are characterized by 
high rates of lineage turnover, so that the genetic diversity circulat-
ing in any particular year largely emerges out of and replaces the 
diversity present in the preceding few years. For human seasonal 
influenza, this behaviour is the result of strong natural selection 
among competing lineages. In such circumstances, a more explicitly 
phylogenetic classification system is used. For example, avian influ-
enza viruses are classified into ‘subtypes’, ‘clades’ and ‘higher-order 
clades’ according to several quantitative criteria5. Such a system can 
provide a convenient way to refer to the emergence of new (and 
potentially antigenically distinct) variants and is suitable for the 
process of selecting the component viruses for the regularly updated 
influenza vaccine. A similar approach to tracking antigenic diver-
sity may be needed to inform SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design efforts. 
While useful, we recognize that dynamic nomenclature systems 
based on genetic distance thresholds have the potential to overac-
cumulate cumbersome lineage names.
In an ongoing and rapidly changing epidemic such as 
SARS-CoV-2, a nomenclature system can facilitate real-time epide-
miology by providing commonly agreed labels to refer to viruses 
circulating in different parts of the world, thereby revealing the links 
between outbreaks that share similar virus genomes. Furthermore, a 
nomenclature system is needed to describe virus lineages that vary

The ongoing pandemic spread of a new human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which is associated with severe pneumonia/disease 
(COVID-19), has resulted in the generation of tens of thousands of virus genome sequences. The rate of genome generation 
is unprecedented, yet there is currently no coherent nor accepted scheme for naming the expanding phylogenetic diversity of 
SARS-CoV-2. Here, we present a rational and dynamic virus nomenclature that uses a phylogenetic framework to identify those 
lineages that contribute most to active spread. Our system is made tractable by constraining the number and depth of hierar-
chical lineage labels and by flagging and delabelling virus lineages that become unobserved and hence are probably inactive. 
By focusing on active virus lineages and those spreading to new locations, this nomenclature will assist in tracking and under-
standing the patterns and determinants of the global spread of SARS-CoV-2.

in phenotypic or antigenic properties. (Although it must be stressed 
that at present there is no conclusive evidence of such variation 
among currently available SARS-CoV-2 strains.)
Principles of a dynamic nomenclature system
There are several key challenges in the development of a dynamic 
and utilitarian nomenclature system for SARS-CoV-2. To be valid 
and broadly accepted a nomenclature needs to: (1) capture local and 
global patterns of virus genetic diversity in a timely and coherent 
manner; (2) track emerging lineages as they move between coun-
tries and populations within each country; (3) be sufficiently robust 
and flexible to accommodate new virus diversity as it is generated; 
and (4) be dynamic, such that it can incorporate both the birth and 
death of viral lineages through time.
A special challenge in the case of COVID-19 is that genome 
sequence data is being generated rapidly and at high volumes, such 
that by the end of the pandemic we can expect hundreds of thou-
sands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to have been sequenced. Therefore, 
any lineage naming system must be capable of handling tens to 
hundreds of thousands of virus genomes sampled longitudinally 
and densely through time. Furthermore, to be practical, any lineage 
naming system should have no more than 100 or 200 active lineage 
labels since any more would obfuscate rather than clarify discussion 
and would be difficult to conceptualize.
To fulfil these requirements, we propose a workable and practical 
lineage nomenclature for SARS-CoV-2 that arises from a set of fun-
damental evolutionary and phylogenetic principles. Some of these 
principles are, necessarily, specific to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
reflecting the new reality of large-scale real-time generation of virus 
genome sequences. The nomenclature system is not intended to 
represent every evolutionary change in SARS-CoV-2 since these 
will number many thousands by the end of the pandemic. Instead, 
the focus is on the genetic changes associated with important epi-
demiological and biological events. Fortunately, because of the early 
sampling and genome sequencing of COVID-19 cases in China, 
especially in Hubei province, it appears that the ‘root sequence’ of 
SARS-CoV-2 is known. Many of the genomes from the earliest sam-
pled cases are genetically identical and hence also probably iden-
tical to the most recent common ancestor of all sampled viruses. 
This occurrence is different to previous viruses and epidemics and 
provides some advantages for the development of a rational and 
scalable classification scheme. Specifically, setting the ‘reference 
sequence’ to be the root sequence forms a natural starting point 
since direct comparisons in the number and position of mutations 
can be made with respect to the root sequence.
During the early phase of the pandemic, it is possible to unambig-
uously assign a genome to a lineage through the presence/absence 
of particular sets of mutations. However, a central component of a 
useful nomenclature system is that it focuses on those virus lineages 
that contribute most to global transmission and genetic diversity. 
Hence, rather than naming every possible new lineage, classification 
should focus on those that have exhibited onward spread in the pop-
ulation, particularly those that have seeded an epidemic in a new 
location. For example, the large epidemic in Lombardy, Northern 
Italy, thought to have begun in early February6, has since been dis-
seminated to other locations in northern Europe and elsewhere.
Furthermore, because SARS-CoV-2 genomes are being gener-
ated continuously and at a similar pace to changes in virus trans-
mission and epidemic control efforts, we expect to see a continual 
process of lineage generation and extinction through time. Rather 
than maintaining a cumulative list of all lineages that have existed 
since the start of the pandemic, it is more prudent to mark lineages 
as ‘active’, ‘unobserved’ or ‘inactive’. This is a designation that reflects 
our current understanding of whether they are actively transmit-
ting in the population or not. Accordingly, lineages of SARS-CoV-2 
documented within the last month are defined as ‘active’ in this 
article, those last seen >1 month but <3 months ago are classified as 
‘unobserved’ and those that have not been seen for >3 months are 
termed ‘inactive’.
Although this strategy allow us to track those lineages that are 
contributing most to the epidemic, and so reduce the number of 
names in use, it is important to keep open the possibility that new 
lineages will appear through the generation of virus genomes from 
unrepresented locations or from cases with travel history from such 
locations. For example, the epidemic in Iran (designated B.4 in our 
system) was identified via returning travellers to other countries7. 
Furthermore, lineages that have not been seen for some time may 
re-emerge after a period of cryptic transmission in a region. Hence, 
it is possible for lineages that were previously classified as inactive 
or unobserved to be later relabelled as active. We chose the term 
‘lineages’ (rather than ‘clades’, ‘genotypes’ or other designations) 
for SARS-CoV-2 because it captures the fact that they are dynamic, 
rather than relying on a static and exclusive hierarchical structure.
Lineage naming rules
We propose that major lineage labels begin with a letter. At the 
root of the phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 are two lineages that we 
simply denote as lineages A and B. The earliest lineage A viruses, 
such as Wuhan/WH04/2020 (EPI_ISL_406801), sampled on 5 
January 2020, share two nucleotides (positions 8,782 in ORF1ab 
and 28,144 in ORF8) with the closest known bat viruses (RaTG13 
and RmYN02). Different nucleotides are present at those sites in 
viruses assigned to lineage B, of which Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank 
accession no. MN908947) sampled on 26 December 2019 is an early 
representative. Hence, although viruses from lineage B happen to 
have been sequenced and published first8–10, it is likely (based on 
current data) that the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of 
the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny shares the same genome sequence as 
the early lineage A sequences (for example, Wuhan/WH04/2020). 
Importantly, this does not imply that the MRCA itself has been 
sampled and sequenced, but rather that no mutations have accrued 
between the MRCA and the early lineage A genome sequences. At 
the time of writing, viruses from both lineages A and B are still cir-
culating in many countries around the world, reflecting the expor-
tation of viruses from Hubei province to other regions of China and 
elsewhere before strict travel restrictions and quarantine measures 
were imposed there.
To add further lineage designations, we downloaded 27,767 com-
plete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the GISAID (Global Initiative on 
Sharing All Influenza Data) database (http://gisaid.org)11 on 18 May 
2020 and estimated a maximum likelihood tree for these data (see 
Methods) (Fig. 1). We defined further SARS-CoV-2 lineages, each 
descending from either lineage A or B, and assigned a numerical 
value (for example, lineage A.1 or lineage B.2). Lineage designations 
were made using the following set of conditions: (1) each descen-
dant lineage should show phylogenetic evidence of emergence from 
an ancestral lineage into another geographically distinct population, 
implying substantial onward transmission in that population. In the 
case of a rapidly expanding global lineage, the recipient population 
may comprise multiple countries. In the case of large and populous 
countries, it may represent a new region or province. To show phylo-
genetic evidence, a new lineage must meet all of the following crite-
ria: (a) it exhibits one or more shared nucleotide differences from the 
ancestral lineage; (b) it comprises at least five genomes with >95% 
of the genome sequenced; (c) genomes within the lineage exhibit at 
least one shared nucleotide change among them; and (d) a bootstrap 
value >70% for the lineage-defining node. Importantly, criterion (c) 
helps to focus attention only on lineages with evidence of ongoing 
transmission; (2) the lineages identified in step 1 can themselves 
act as ancestors for virus lineages that then emerge in other geo-
graphical areas or at later times, provided they satisfy criteria a–d. 
This results in a new lineage designation (for example, A.1.1); (3)

the iterative procedure in step 2 can proceed for a maximum of 
three sublevels (for example, A.1.1.1) after which new descendant 
lineages are given a letter (in English alphabetical sequence from 
C) so A.1.1.1.1 would become C.1 and A.1.1.1.2 would become C.2. 
The rationale for this is that the system is intended only for tracking 
currently circulating lineages, such that we do not try to capture the 
entire history of a lineage in its label. (That complete history can 
be obtained by reference to a phylogeny.) At the time of writing,

no C level lineages have been assigned; (4) all sequences are assigned 
to one lineage. For example, if a genome does not meet the criteria 
for inclusion in a ‘higher-level’ lineage (for example, A.1.2, B.1.3.5) 
then it is automatically classified into the lowest level for which it 
meets the inclusion criteria, which ultimately is A or B.
Using this scheme, we identified 81 viral lineages. These lineages 
mostly belong to A, B and B.1. We identified six lineages derived 
from lineage A (denoted A.1–A.6) and two descendant sublineages 
of A.1 (A.1.1 and A.3). We also describe 16 lineages directly derived 
from lineage B. To date, lineage B.1 is the predominant known 
global lineage and has been subdivided into >70 sublineages. 
Lineage B.2 currently has six descendant sublineages. We are not 
yet able to further subdivide the other lineages, even though some 
contain very large numbers of genomes. This is because many parts 
of the world experienced numerous imported cases followed by 
exponential growth in local transmission. We provide descriptions 
of these initial lineages, including their geographical locations and 
time span of sampling, in Table 1. We have also tried to be flexible 
with the criteria where, for example, the bootstrap value is below 
70% but there is strong previous evidence that the lineage exists and 
is epidemiologically important. In particular, the Italian epidemic 
comprises two large lineages in our scheme—B.1 and B.2—reflect-
ing genomes from Italy as well as from large numbers of travellers 
from these regions and that fall into both lineages.
A unique and important aspect of our proposed nomenclature 
is that the status of the currently circulating lineages be assessed 
at regular intervals, with decisions made about identifying new 
lineages and flagging those we believe are likely be unobserved or 
inactive because none of their members have been sequenced for 
a considerable time. The names of unobserved or inactive lineages 
will not be reassigned. These are provisional timescales and the cat-
egory thresholds may be altered in the future once the dynamics of 
lineage generation and extinction are better understood. When visu-
alizing the epidemic, we suggest that these lineages should no longer 
be labelled to reduce both the number of names in circulation and 
visual noise, and focus on the current epidemiological situation.
Discussion
While we regard this proposed nomenclature as practical and 
robust, it is important to recognize that phylogenetic inference car-
ries statistical uncertainty and much of the available genome data 
is noisy, with incomplete genome coverage and errors arising from 
the amplification and sequencing processes. We have suggested a 
genome coverage threshold for proposing new lineages and we fur-
ther suggest that sequences are not ascribed a lineage designation 
unless the genome coverage of that sequence exceeds 70% of the 
coding region. As noted earlier, when SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity 
is low during the early pandemic period, there is a direct association 
between lineage assignation and the presence of particular sets of 
mutations (with respect to the root sequence). This should help with 
the development of rapid, algorithmic genome labelling tools. This 
task will become more complex, but still tractable, as SARS-CoV-2 
genetic diversity accumulates, increasing the chance of both homo-
plasies and reverse mutations. Classification algorithms based on 
lists of ‘lineage-defining’ mutations may be practical if they are 
frequently cross-checked and validated against phylogenetic esti-
mations but will not be as powerful as phylogenetic classification 
methods, which make use of complete genome sequence data to 
identify relationships. We encourage the research community to 
develop software and online tools that will enable the automated 
classification of newly generated genomes (one such implementa-
tion is pangolin, https://github.com/hCoV-2019/pangolin).
Coronaviruses also frequently recombine, meaning that a single 
phylogenetic tree may not always adequately capture the evolution-
ary history of SARS-CoV-2. Although this can make phylogenetic 
analysis challenging, recombination is readily accommodated 
within this system of lineage naming and assignment. A distinct 
recombination event, if it establishes onward transmission, will cre-
ate a new viral lineage with a distinct common ancestor. Because 
this new lineage does not have a single ancestral lineage, it will be 
assigned the next available alphabetical prefix.
While we believe our proposed lineage nomenclature will greatly 
assist those working with COVID-19, we do not see it as exclusive 
to other naming systems, particularly those that are specifically 
intended to track lineages circulating within individual countries for 
which a finer scale will be helpful. Indeed, there are likely to be strong 
sampling biases towards particular countries. Furthermore, we note 
that future genome sequence generation may require adjustments 
to the current proposal; any such changes will be detailed at http://
cov-lineages.org/. However, we envisage that the general approach 
described in this study may be readily adopted for these purposes 
and for other viral epidemics where real-time genomic epidemiol-
ogy is being undertaken. We expect this dynamic nomenclature 
to be most useful for the duration of the global pandemic, which 
may last a few years. After that time, SARS-CoV-2 will be either 
globally eliminated or, more likely, become an endemic or seasonal 
infection. The remaining endemic/seasonal lineages, which will be 
genetically distinct by then, can simply retain their names from the 
dynamic nomenclature system in the post-pandemic period.

(Wuhan-Hu-1). We aligned these sequences using the MAFFT FFT-NS-2 
algorithm and default parameter settings12. We then estimated a maximum

substitution14,15, default heuristic search options and ultrafast bootstrapping with 
1,000 replicates16.
The maximum likelihood tree and associated sequence metadata were 
manually curated and the phylogeny was annotated with the lineage designations. 
This annotated tree, along with a table providing the lineage designation for each

have also provided a high-resolution figure (in PDF format) of the entire tree 
labelled with lineages. These will be updated on a regular basis. Representative 
sequences from each lineage were selected to maximize within-lineage diversity 
and minimize N-content and used to construct the maximum likelihood tree 
shown in Fig. 1.

in reporting. For further information on Nature Research policies, see Authors & Referees and the Editorial Policy Checklist.
Statistics
For all statistical analyses, confirm that the following items are present in the figure legend, table legend, main text, or Methods section.
n/a Confirmed
The exact sample size (�) for each experimental group/condition, given as a discrete number and unit of measurement
A statement on whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same sample was measured repeatedly
The statistical test(s) used AND whether they are one- or two-sided 
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
A description of all covariates tested
A description of any assumptions or corrections, such as tests of normality and adjustment for multiple comparisons
A full description of the statistical parameters including central tendency (e.g. means) or other basic estimates (e.g. regression coefficient) 
AND variation (e.g. standard deviation) or associated estimates of uncertainty (e.g. confidence intervals)
For null hypothesis testing, the test statistic (e.g. �, �, �) with confidence intervals, effect sizes, degrees of freedom and � value noted 
������������������������������������������������
For Bayesian analysis, information on the choice of priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo settings
For hierarchical and complex designs, identification of the appropriate level for tests and full reporting of outcomes
Estimates of effect sizes (e.g. Cohen's �, Pearson's �), indicating how they were calculated

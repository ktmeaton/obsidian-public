Abstract 
Tracking the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 is critical to inform public health 
interventions. Phylodynamic analyses have quantified SARS-CoV-2 migration on global and 
local scales1–5, yet they have not been applied to determine transmission dynamics in Canada. 
We quantified SARS-CoV-2 migration into, within, and out of Canada in the context of COVID-
19 travel restrictions. To minimize sampling bias, global sequences were subsampled with 
probabilities corrected for their countries’ monthly contribution to global new diagnoses. A time-
scaled maximum likelihood tree was used to estimate most likely ancestral geographic locations 
(country or Canadian province), enabling identification of sublineages, defined as introduction 
events into Canada resulting in domestic transmission. Of 402 Canadian sublineages identified, 
the majority likely originated from the USA (54%), followed by Russia (7%), India (6%), Italy 
(6%), and the UK (5%). International introductions were mostly into Ontario (39%) and Quebec 
(38%). Among Pango lineages6, B.1 was imported at least 191 separate times from 11 different 
countries. Introduction rates peaked in late March then diminished but were not eliminated 
following national interventions including restrictions on non-essential travel. We further 
identified 1,380 singleton importations, international importations that did not result in further 
sampled transmission, whereby representation of lineages and location were comparable to 
sublineages. Although proportion of international transmission decreased over time, this 
coincided with exponential growth of within-province transmission – in fact, total number of 
sampled transmission events from international or interprovincial sources increased from winter 
2020 into spring 2020 in many provinces. Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia acted as 
sources of transmission more than recipients, within the caveat of higher sequence 
representation. We present strong evidence that international introductions and interprovincial 
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 contributed to the Canadian COVID-19 burden throughout 2020, 
despite initial reductions mediated by travel restrictions in 2020. More stringent border controls 
and quarantine measures may have curtailed introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Canada and 
may still be warranted.

Significance Statement 
By analyzing SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Canada in the context of the global pandemic, we 
illuminate the extent to which the COVID-19 burden in Canada was perpetuated by ongoing 
international importations and interprovincial transmission throughout 2020. Although travel 
restrictions enacted in March 2020 reduced the importation rate and proportion of transmission 
from abroad across all Canadian provinces, SARS-CoV-2 introductions from the USA, India, 
Russia, and other nations were detectable through the summer and fall of 2020.  
 
Introduction 
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has highlighted the importance of genomic epidemiology in 
deciphering the origin and spread of emerging pathogens across local, national, and global 
scales to aid in directing responses. These analyses are entirely dependent upon the timely 
generation, assembly, and sharing of publicly available genetic sequences and associated 
metadata through the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) platform. The 
global effort to sequence and share SARS-CoV-2 genomes has been unprecedented, such that 
by 11 February 2021, just over a year since the first whole genome sequence was shared7,8, 
there were 495,159 SARS-CoV-2 sequences publicly available on GISAID representing 
108,301,802 confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses9. Studying evolutionary relationships between 
SARS-CoV-2 samples over time and space using molecular phylogenetics illuminates 
underlying epidemic dynamics, such as the relative contributions of international and domestic 
transmission, and in doing so can be highly informative in evaluating whether particular non-
pharmaceutical interventions have been effective in curbing importations from abroad, as well 
as transmission within jurisdictions. 
 
Although SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a relatively slow substitution rate on a per site basis 
compared to other RNA viruses, its evolutionary rate per genome is comparable or high due to 
its large genome of 29 kb compared to the average of 9 kb10, as well as its high transmission 
rate. Thus ample divergence has accumulated to distinguish globally sampled viruses into 
groups defined by common mutations and recent ancestry; the most commonly applied 
nomenclature include clades as defined by Nextstrain19,20 and phylogenetic Pango lineages6. 
Tracking phylogenetic lineages’ spatiotemporal movement is useful to better understand the 
relative contributions of importations and local transmission. The importance of partitioning 
sequences into a dynamic and accurate nomenclature system is critical because it allows a 
common framework for genomic surveillance and for discussion of emerging variants of concern 
(VOC)6,11.   
 
Tracking the dynamics and genomic characteristics of VOC – notably B.1.351, B.1.1.7, 
and P.1 - has become a critical global concern in light of their potential to hamper the 
effectiveness of vaccines and non-pharmaceutical interventions. In early August 2020, the 
B.1.351 variant, also known as 501Y.V2, was first detected in South Africa12; this was quickly 
followed by the identification of the B.1.1.7 variant, which was first sampled in Southern England 
in September 2020 and rapidly rose in frequency11. Shortly thereafter, the P.1 variant (alias: 
B.1.1.28.1), emerged in Manaus, Brazil in early December 202013. As the B.1.351 and P.1 
lineages harbour E484K, K417T, and N501Y, it seems likely that they display elevated capacity 
for immune evasion13. The 69-70 deletion in spike, which co-occurs with N501Y in B.1.1.7, has 
also been implicated in immune escape14,15. The rapid global emergence and spread of VOC 
and the risk they pose towards the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions and 
vaccines emphasizes the importance of identifying and tracking novel variants and their 
introduction into new geographical regions. 
 
Relatively early in the COVID-19 epidemic, on 25 January 2020, the first case in Canada 
was detected in a traveller from Wuhan to Toronto, where it was suspected that onward

transmission was limited to his wife16(Fig. S1). It was not until 20 February that Canada reported 
its first case related to travel from outside mainland China. In the province of British Columbia, 
sequences from within the lineages A and A.1, which diverged from the B lineages early in the 
pandemic, were identified through March and April, alongside international events in Vancouver, 
British Columbia, namely an international dentistry conference 5-7 March where at least 42 
people were infected17 and the World Rugby 7s on 7–9 March. Another notable Canadian 
superspreader event simultaneously occurred in Edmonton, Alberta at a curling bonspiel 
(tournament) on 11 March attended by doctors from across Western Canada18, where 45 out of 
70 participants were infected. In the subsequent week, the stringency of Canadian interventions 
increased rapidly (Fig. S1). On 14 March, a travel advisory warning against all non-essential 
travel outside Canada was issued; on 18 March, travel restrictions on the entry of all foreign 
nationals (except from the United States) were announced; 21 March travel restrictions were 
extended to the USA; and 24 March, the mandatory 14-day self-isolation for those returning 
from international travel was announced. By 9 June, travel restrictions on foreign nationals with 
immediate family in Canada relaxed19. Studies of the genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in 
Canada have been heretofore been limited to a single study focusing exclusively on the early 
epidemic in Quebec20. Murall et al. conservatively estimated more than 200 independent events 
into Quebec by late March, suggesting that international introductions in were largely 
attributable to the province’s “spring break”, which occurred 2-3 weeks earlier than the rest of 
Canada20. Similar analyses have not yet been applied at a national scale, and the relative 
contributions of international introductions and interprovincial transmission in sustaining the 
COVID pandemic in Canada are not well-understood, despite their potential importance in 
responding to future pandemics or resurgences of SARS-CoV-2. Despite some common 
interventions, provincial and territorial cumulative incidences (Fig. S2) and response 
stringencies21 have drastically differed; thus, we expect that viral evolutionary dynamics should 
also vary. 
 
Phylogeographic methods to infer ancestral states of sampled viruses have been applied 
widely to quantify the timing and geographic origins of SARS-CoV-2 introductions into the 
United Kingdom (UK)5, United States of America (USA)1–3,22, Brazil23,24, New Zealand (NZ)4,25, 
and Europe1,26, among others. Drastically different epidemic dynamics have been elucidated 
globally. For example, in the UK, with the highest sequences per case of any country27, du 
Plessis et al. conservatively estimated 1,179 independent introductions resulting in 2 or more 
sampled descendant cases5. Importantly, their analyses revealed that detection lag – the 
amount of time between the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) and the first 
sample collection date for a given UK transmission lineage – decreased over time as more 
genomes were generated, suggesting that efficiency in detecting and responding to importations 
improved over time. An analysis of early epidemic dynamics in the state of Louisiana, USA, 
revealed starkly contrasting importation dynamics, wherein the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 was 
almost entirely attributable to a single domestic introduction. This introduction likely originated 
from Texas, which occurred several weeks prior to the annual Mardi Gras festival, during which 
superspreader events likely gave rise to a large number of cases within Louisiana and 
neighbouring Southern states22. Furthermore, in NZ, where border closures and stringent 
lockdown measures were enacted early in the pandemic4, reductions in international 
introductions and in reproductive numbers following lockdown were proportional to the reduction 
in mobility nationwide4. Illustrating the challenges of incorporating phylogenetic methods into 
public health responses, their analyses also revealed instances where individuals who were 
previously considered connected through contact tracing were not phylogenetically proximate or 
linked through a recent transmission event, and conversely, individuals’ viruses being highly 
similar despite no known contact. Geoghegan et al. further corroborated the effectiveness of the 
public health response in NZ, as they estimated that of 227 inferred introductions to NZ up to

July 1 2020, 24% led to one downstream case and only 19% resulted in more than one 
downstream case4. Similar analyses are yet to be conducted for Canada. 
 
Here we estimated the timing, origins, and destinations of SARS-CoV-2 introductions in 
Canada throughout 2020 for both singleton importations with no further sampled transmission 
and Canadian sublineages, which are introductions that ignited sampled domestic outbreaks. 
We applied a maximum likelihood approach to test the hypotheses that international 
importations of SARS-CoV-2 into Canada were reduced following the implementation of 
Canada-wide travel restrictions, as well as whether international importations contributed to 
ongoing transmission throughout the spring, summer, and fall of 2020. We further tested the 
hypotheses that over time testing and tracing may have improved such that there were fewer 
importations resulting in onward domestic transmission, smaller sublineages, and smaller 
delays in identifying new sublineages. These analyses contribute to a finer resolution 
understanding of how international importations acted as sparks that ignited ongoing SARS-
CoV-2 outbreaks throughout Canada in 2020.    
 
Methods 
Timeline of COVID-19 in Canada 
The dates of national-level COVID-19 interventions were obtained from the Canadian Institute 
for Health Information19 and the key events were obtained from a summary published by the 
National Post16. The Stringency Index for Canada was obtained from the Oxford COVID-19 
Government Response Tracker28 (Fig. S1). 
 
Data cleaning 
A total of 495,159 SARS-CoV-2 sequences were downloaded from GISAID with associated 
metadata, of which 9,862 were sampled in Canada, on 11 February 2021 (www.gisaid.org; 
contributing labs in Supplementary Appendix). Sequences were aligned pairwise to the Wuhan-
Hu-1 reference sequence (Genbank Accession ID: MN908947.3) using the viralMSA wrapper 
tool invoking minimap229,30. Subsequently, sequences were removed from the analysis if they 
were listed in the Nextstrain exclusion list on the day of data download31,32. This list identifies 
duplicate depositions (i.e., multiple samples from the same individual) or samples that contained 
known sequencing issues (n=788), contained >20% Ns (n=198) or >10% gaps (n=21,133, 
including 44 that also had high Ns), were sampled from a non-human host (n=925), were 
environmental samples (n=123), were likely to contain sequencing errors based on previous 
temporal analyses (n=2)33, or had incomplete sample collection dates (n=5,795). Canadian 
sequences with incomplete collection dates (n=2,168) were retained, however 82 of them were 
removed as they also lacked the month of collection, and the missing dates were inferred using 
LSD2 within IQ-TREE 2.1.235,36 while converting the tree with branch lengths scaled in 
substitutions/site into a time-scaled tree under a relaxed molecular clock (see phylogenetic 
inference below). More recently, updated full sample collection dates from Japan (n=15,997) 
and the USA (n=1) were added to the metadata prior to excluding incomplete dates.  
There were 466,025 clean sequences remaining, of which 9,657 were Canadian. 
Problematic sites (v4.3) identified by de Maio et al.34 were masked in the alignment. These sites 
include the untranslated ends of the alignment, which have low coverage and a high rate of 
sequencing or mapping errors, highly homoplasic sites with low prevalence and/or low 
phylogenetic signal, homoplasic sites specific to particular locations or labs, and homoplasic 
sites with strong phylogenetic signal. Nextstrain clade and Pango lineage designations were 
made before masking sites.  
 
Subsampling sequences 
To minimize the impact of sampling bias on our analyses and minimise computational effort, we 
randomly sampled sequences to adjust for countries’ proportional contribution to new global

COVID-19 cases in each month. Using the coronavirus R package9, country-specific new 
diagnosis counts by day were aggregated by month. For each calendar month, the proportion of 
total new diagnoses in each country among all new global diagnoses (minus Canada) was 
applied as a sampling probability for sequences from that month (Fig. 1a). Sequences were 
sampled without replacement. We strove to equalize the number of sequences sampled 
monthly; however there were relatively few sequences available until March 2020. Therefore, all 
clean sequences in the preceding months were included and the remainder of sequences 
sampled were distributed among well-sampled months (Table S1). The number of clean 
sequences available by month for Canadian provinces is summarized in Table S2. We mapped 
provinces with available sequences and annotated their cumulative per capita incidence (Fig. 
S2) using population data and NAD83 shapefiles from the Statistics Canada 2016 Census37,38 
and NAD83 shapefiles for the USA from the United States Census Bureau39. The number of 
cases by Canadian province over time was obtained from the Public Health Agency of 
Canada40. 
 
With the aim of subsampling 50,000 sequences total for computational feasibility while 
focusing on Canadian dynamics, we sampled all 9,657 clean Canadian sequences and the 
remainder of 40,333 from the pool of global clean sequences (n=456,368). The probability of 
selecting any given global sequence was adjusted for its country’s contribution to monthly global 
new diagnoses, excluding Canada. To account for underrepresentation of sequences from Iran 
and Italy early in the epidemic despite their known importance in early transmission dynamics1, 
sequences from individuals who had travel history to Iran or Italy were recategorized as having 
been sampled in the country of travel if the sampling date predated June 2020 – this affected 
five Canadian sequences across February and March 2020. The relative contribution of 
geographies to the global sequence set before and after subsampling is summarized in Fig. 1b-
c, while the overall sequence representation (# sequences / # confirmed diagnoses) for each 
geography before and after subsampling is shown in Fig. S3.  
 
Maximum likelihood phylogenetic inference 
We used the subsampled alignment to infer an approximate maximum likelihood (ML) 
phylogeny using FastTree version 2.2.141 with a generalized time-reversible substitution model 
with random starting tree seeds. The tree was rooted using R package ape42 on the earliest 
lineage A sequence (EPI_ISL_406801, sampled 05 January 2020) based on the presence of 
two nucleotides not found in the commonly used reference (Wuhan-Hu-1, sampled 26 
December 2019), which are shared with the most proximate bat coronaviruses identified thus 
far, RaTG13 and RmYN026. We then fit a slope of evolutionary distance (number of inferred 
substitutions between root and tips) over time using Tempest43 and excluded temporal outliers 
with residuals further than the mean residual plus or minus 3 standard deviations (n=385) (Fig. 
S4a). To further clean the data of temporal outliers, any tips with pendant edges (edge 
immediately preceding tip) with more than 12 mutations after masking were removed (n=328), 
under the justification that it would take about 6 months for 12 mutations to accumulate if we 
assume a strict molecular clock of 8e-4 substitutions/site/year (Fig. S4b). The molecular clock 
rate fit before and after removing temporal outliers is shown in Fig. S4c-d. The cleaned tree in 
units of substitutions/site was converted to a time-scaled tree using LSD2 invoked within IQ-
TREE 2.1.2, specifying a lognormal relaxed clock with 0.2 standard deviations, as well as a 
generalized time-reversible substitution model with gamma rate variation, invariant sites, and 
three discrete rate categories (GTR+I+R3), which was identified as the best-fitting model for a 
global phylogeny44, Wuhan-Hu-1 as outgroup (used because of its earlier sample date than 
EPI_ISL_406801), and 100 bootstraps to calculate confidence intervals on inferred 
dates35,36(Fig. S10). A total of 2,168 Canadian sequences had incomplete dates that were 
inferred simultaneously with internal node dates and the relaxed molecular clock, of which the 
greatest contributors were Ontario (n=1,338) and British Columbia (n=814), followed by Alberta

(n=12) and Quebec (n=4). Time-scaled trees were resolved into binary trees by randomly 
resolving polytomies using the multi2di function in R package ape42, and branch lengths of zero 
were assigned a negligibly small value of the minimum non-zero branch length multiplied by 1e-
8. Due to LSD2 computational limits encountered while simultaneously estimating the relaxed 
molecular clock while inferring incomplete tip dates, even when specifying up to 64 threads on a 
computing cluster, 1,348 tip dates inferred in an earlier build using data up to 15 January 2021 
were input as fixed dates in LSD2 in the present analysis. 
 
Maximum likelihood discrete ancestral state reconstruction 
Each tip state was assigned as the patient’s sampling location (except for travelers to Iran and 
Italy, for reasons described above), which was either Canadian province or country of sampling. 
We applied maximum likelihood discrete ancestral state reconstruction on the time-scaled tree 
using the ace function of R package ape42, and the highest likelihood state was pulled for each 
internal node. Canadian sublineages were designated as international introductions resulting in 
onward transmission with a minimum of two downstream sequenced cases, where a Canadian 
internal node was preceded by a non-Canadian internal node. It should be noted that a 
Canadian sublineage may comprise multiple transmission clusters or outbreaks, and could even 
include multiple introductions of identical viruses. We estimated the time of most recent 
common ancestor (tMRCA) for introduction nodes using the bootstrap time-scaled trees inferred 
in LSD2 via IQ-TREE 2.1.2 with a relaxed molecular clock and 100 bootstrap trees to estimate 
95% confidence intervals. The tMRCA represents the first inferred transmission event resulting 
in a sampled Canadian sublineage. We interrogated whether any of the sublineages’ tMRCAs 
supported that SARS-CoV-2 was circulating prior to detection in Canada in early 2020.  
 
Sublineage detection lag and number of descendants analyses 
Each sublineage’s detection lag was estimated as the number of days between the tMRCA and 
the first Canadian sample collection date (Fig. S11). The detection lag and number of 
descendants, respectively, between provinces were compared using a non-parametric Kruskal-
Wallis rank sum test, followed by a pairwise Dunn’s rank sum test with Bonferroni p-value 
adjustment46. An alpha value of 0.05 was deemed as significant. Subsequently, we evaluated 
whether sublineages’ detection lag was associated with the tMRCA using multiple linear 
regression, as well as whether the number of descendants in each sublineage was associated 
with the tMRCA within a negative binomial model using the R package MASS45. For each 
model, the inclusion of province as a confounder was evaluated using anova likelihood ratio 
tests and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Finally, the relationship between detection lag 
and the number of descendants was described using a negative binomial model using the R 
package MASS45 (Fig. S12).  
 
Origins of sampled transmission events 
In addition to evaluating international importations into Canada resulting in domestic 
transmission (i.e., Canadian sublineages), we further evaluated the ancestral state of all 
Canadian tips in the phylogeny, representing all transmission events in which a sampled 
Canadian was the recipient. Canadian tips represent either descendants of a Canadian 
sublineage or singletons, which are international importation events with no further sampled 
downstream transmission. Notably, Geoghegan et al. defined a singleton as an introduction 
leading to one other secondary case, in contrast to an introduction with no sampled ongoing 
transmission4. However, du Plessis et al. defined singletons as genomes that were not assigned 
to any importations resulting in 2 or more sequences sampled5. We follow this definition, 
whereby singletons are sampled Canadian genomes with international transmission sources, no 
sampled descendants, outside of Canadian sublineages. Together, the singletons and the 
Canadian sublineages represent all the distinguishable, unique, and sampled importations of

SARS-CoV-2 from abroad. The proportion of international importations resulting in no further 
transmission, i.e., a singleton, over time was stratified by season (Winter 2020: 22 December 
2019 – 19 March 2020; Spring 2020: 20 March 2020 – 19 June 2020; Summer 2020: 20 June 
2020 – 21 September 2020; Fall 2020: 22 September – 20 December 2020l; and Winter 2021: 
21 December 2020 – 19 March 2021) and either province of introduction or origin location in 
order to evaluate whether there were significant temporal changes. We applied non-parametric 
Kruskal-Wallis tests to evaluate the hypothesis that the proportion of introductions resulting in a 
sublineage (versus a singleton) should decrease over time as Canada improved its testing, 
contact tracing, and quarantine compliance. We mapped the total and proportional contribution 
of all international sources to sampled transmission events by province and season (Fig. 5). 
Between-province sampled transmission events were summarized as a matrix (Fig. S13).  
 
Results 
Subsampled global sequences better reflect countries’ relative case contributions 
We reduced the overrepresentation of sequences from certain countries with the highest 
sequencing effort (notably the UK, Australia, and Denmark) by subsampling the global 
sequences proportionally to each country’s contribution to global new diagnoses by month (Fig. 
1a-c). Since this is a Canadian focused analysis, the contribution of subsampled Canadian 
sequences outweighs Canada’s overall contribution to global new diagnoses, but otherwise is 
representative of global pandemic dynamics (Fig. 1c). The fit of the overall relationship between 
countries’ monthly new diagnoses and sequences was improved following subsampling, 
increasing the R2 from 0.52 to 0.72, and yielding a final average sequence representation of 
0.016 (total number sequences/total number of confirmed diagnoses) (Table S1; Fig. S3).  
 
Since all clean Canadian GISAID sequences (n= 9,657) were kept in the subsampling 
process to maximize our ability to detect international importations, there remain discrepancies 
between Canadian provinces’ contributions of new diagnoses (among provinces with available 
sequences) and contributions of sequences over time (Fig. 1d-e). However, the overall 
sequence representation relative to new diagnoses was comparable across provinces (Fig. 1f), 
with a median sequence representation of 0.014 (minimum= 0.010, Quebec; maximum= 0.29, 
Nova Scotia). Gaps in the availability of sequences over time varied greatly by province (Table 
S2) and is a caveat to our analysis. There are no sequences representing British Columbia, 
New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, or Nova Scotia for summer 2020 (and only 1 
sequence from Alberta). Quebec has not deposited any sequences corresponding to collection 
dates after September 2020, and there are zero sequences sampled in fall 2020 from Alberta, 
New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nova Scotia. Additionally, there were no 
sequences available from any cases in Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Saskatchewan, 
or Prince Edward Island, despite representing 3.4% COVID-19 cases in Canada (Table S3). 
 
Diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in Canada 
We estimated that the root age of the subsampled SARS-CoV-2 global phylogeny with a 
Canadian focus was 09 December 2019 (95% CI: 27 October – 10 December) (Fig. 2) and 
exhibited a lognormal relaxed clock rate of 2.66e-4 (2.61e-4, 2.70e-4) substitutions/site/year 
after having specified a prior of 0.2 standard deviation. This contrasts notably with the strict 
clock rate that we inferred in Tempest, which after removing temporal outliers was estimated as 
7.47e-4 substitutions/site/year (Fig. S4d). Notably, these were both estimated on trees inferred 
from masked alignments.  
 
The high diversity of SARS-CoV-2 lineages sequenced in Canada illustrates the role of 
international transmission in the context of the global pandemic. A total of 79 unique Pango 
lineages were detected in the clean Canadian sequences publicly available at the time of 
analysis, however, since the same lineage may have been introduced multiple times

independently, examining the number of lineages over time in Canada does not directly address 
whether these viruses were the result of singular or multiple introduction events.  
 
Diverse origins of Canadian sublineages 
By applying discrete ancestral state reconstruction upon time-scaled phylogenies, we 
conservatively estimated that there were at least 402 SARS-CoV-2 introductions resulting in 
ongoing transmission into Canada by February 2021 (Fig. 3). Additionally, we identified 1,380 
singleton importations that did not result in further sampled transmission and were not within a 
Canadian sublineage. Since the 9,657 clean samples represent 1.2% of the 817,163 confirmed 
diagnoses in Canada on 11 February, there could have been upwards of 33,500 sublineages 
identified had all confirmed diagnoses been sequenced, assuming that samples were 
sequenced randomly. If we further account for unascertained cases and assume a conservative 
mean case detection rate of 0.4247, this upper estimate doubles. While these assumptions are 
likely imprecise, our estimates are nonetheless conservative. 
 
The large majority of sublineages were supported by high likelihoods (>0.9) in both 
introduction and parent nodes (79%) (Fig. S5). The majority of introductions were into Ontario 
(n=155), followed by Quebec (n=152), British Columbia (n=49), Manitoba (n=22), Alberta (n=9), 
Nova Scotia (n=11), Newfoundland and Labrador (n=3), and New Brunswick (n=1) (Fig. 3a). B.1 
was the most frequently introduced lineage (n=191); however we note it includes a broad 
diversity of sequences. Additionally, there were more than ten introductions of A.1 (n=25), 
B.1.1.119 (n=23), B.1.2 (n=21), and B.1.36 (n=14) (Fig. S6). There was only one introduction of 
a VOC (B.1.1.7) resulting in two sampled descendants; however, since we completed our 
analysis, this number has increased substantially following the completion of this analysis. 
  
The proportion of confirmed diagnoses that were sequenced was comparable across 
provinces (Fig. 1f); however, seasonally, there were large gaps in sequence representation from 
particular provinces (i.e. no sequences available from British Columbia in summer 2020) (Fig. 
1e; Table S2) that lend some uncertainty to these results. While cases in Canada were low in 
summer 2020 (Table S3), they were not zero. Low sequence representation likely led to 
underestimations of the number of introductions, but could also have prevented us from 
connecting sequences between provinces that were linked in the transmission chain.  
 
On the origin of Canadian sublineages (Fig. 3b), only two introductions were inferred to 
have originated directly from China, whilst 54% (n=218) of sublineages originated from the USA, 
followed by Russia (n=29), Italy (n=25), India (n=25), UK (n=22), Spain (n=15), France (n=15), 
and Iran (n=8) among others. We identified 9,742 downstream sampled descendants of 
Canadian sublineages isolated from 77 other countries, representing all continents except 
Antarctica (Fig. 3c). While the majority of descendants were sampled within Canadian provinces 
(n=8,210), this should be interpreted with caution as the global sequences were heavily 
subsampled – therefore sampled descendants are vastly underestimated. Sublineage sizes 
(number of sampled descendants) varied widely (Fig. 3d) and the largest sublineage had 2,137 
sampled descendants and was of the B.1 lineage. 
 
Sublineage introduction rates over time 
Using the time-scaled phylogenies, we estimated the time of the most recent common ancestors 
(tMRCA) corresponding to introduction nodes. The tMRCA is an approximation of the date of 
the first transmission event resulting in a downstream sampled descendant following 
introduction of the virus into Canada, which can differ from the index case by one or more 
generations. By tracking the tMRCA of sublineages over time, we can decipher the temporal 
dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 importations into Canada (Fig. 4). Equivalent plots with sublineages’ 
first Canadian sample collection dates are in Fig. S9. The majority of sublineages were 
introduced in February and March of 2020 across all provinces, but most notably into Quebec, 
which had a maximal weekly rate of 32.7 new sublineages per week on 21 March 2020, without

including singletons. Correspondingly, a maximum of 31.1 new sublineages were introduced 
from the USA on 22 March. Ontario reached its peak a week later on 29 March, wherein the 
rolling weekly introduction rate peaked at 11 new sublineages per week. It is worth noting that 
over this period, a large number of Canadians were repatriated from around the world and this 
likely contributed to a delay in reduction of the importation rates. Subsequently, new sublineage 
introduction rates across most provinces dropped sharply; for instance, comparing the mean 
weekly introduction rates from 1 week and 4 weeks after travel restrictions were enacted, 
Quebec British Columbia, and Ontario respectively had 18.5, 2.5, and 1.9 times fewer new 
sublineage introductions. Despite these reductions, introductions were not eliminated. 
Throughout the summer and fall of 2020, we detected ongoing introductions into Quebec, 
Ontario, Manitoba, and British Columbia imported from the USA, India, Russia, and other 
nations. Again, we must emphasize that our ability to detect importation is directly proportional 
to the availability of sequences. For instance, there were no available sequences from British 
Columbia in the summer of 2020, and the only sequences we have from New Brunswick and 
Alberta are from the spring of 2020. The importation rate increased in Ontario (the province with 
the most consistently deposited sequences and the most incomplete sample dates) in 
September 2020 and again at the end of November 2020 – on 27 November, there were on 
average 8.1 new sublineages introduced into Ontario per week. Tracking the first Canadian 
sample date (Fig. S9) instead of the date of the most recent common ancestor (Fig. 4), revealed 
a similar pattern with a delayed peak in sampled introductions due to the detection lag. The 
most recent sublineage introduction we detected was the B.1.1.7 lineage into Ontario from UK 
in the last week of December, resulting in two sampled descendants.  
 
Sublineage detection lags and number of descendants analyses 
We estimated the detection lag as the number of days between the tMRCA and the first 
Canadian sample collection date among sublineage descendants (Fig. S11). The importation 
date of virus sublineages first arriving in Canada is more challenging to infer and precedes the 
tMRCA by an importation lag4. By applying a Kruskal-Wallis test, we identified that there were 
significant differences between sublineages' detection lags between provinces (p-value = 0.016) 
(Fig. S12a). A further pairwise Dunn's test revealed that the only significant difference was 
between Ontario and British Columbia (p=0.019); the median detection lag in Ontario was 13 
while it was only 3 in British Columbia. Upon investigating whether detection lag was associated 
with sublineages' tMRCA, adjusting for province of introduction significantly improved the 
goodness-of-fit as assessed by a likelihood ratio test although there was no support for effect 
modification. Thus, we found a modest, but significant effect that for every 30 days later in the 
year the tMRCA occurred, the detection lag was on average 2.0 days smaller (0.93 - 0.31), 
adjusted for province (Fig. 12b; Table S4). Subsequently, we evaluated whether sublineages' 
size was associated with the tMRCA. In exploratory analyses, we found no significant 
differences of sublineage sizes between provinces (Kruskal-Wallis: p-value = 0.08). However, 
we found a significant relationship between the tMRCA and number of sampled descendants in 
a negative binomial model without adjusting for province (Fig. 12c; Table S5). Upon identifying 
decreasing trends of both sublineage size and detection lag over time, we evaluated their 
relationship directly in a negative binomial model, adjusting for province. We found that that 
longer detection lags were significantly associated with larger sublineages (p<0.001), such that 
for every 10 days additional lag, there were on average 10.2 additional sampled descendants, 
adjusted for province (Fig. 12d; Table S6). 
 
Relative transmission source contributions and singletons 
To further evaluate the hypothesis that travel restrictions reduced, but did not eliminate, 
international importations, we queried the parental node state for all Canadian tips to discern the 
likely origins of sampled tips, to identify singletons, and to quantify relative contributions of

sampled transmission attributable to either: within-province, interprovincial, USA, or other 
international. In contrast to our sublineage analyses above, this analysis focused solely on 
transmission events immediately preceding a sampled tip.  
There were 1,380 singleton genomes, which were likely importations from international 
sources without sampled descendants that were not in a Canadian sublineage. Upon removing 
the criteria to be outside a sublineage, an additional 7 singletons appeared. It is possible that 
singletons were designated as such only because their descendants were not included in the 
subsample (or ever sampled). The distributions of tips’ locations (transmission recipient) and 
inferred locations of origin (transmission source) over time (Fig. S14; S15) largely mimic the 
trends seen among introductions resulting in domestic transmission (Fig. 4), with a peak in 
importations in late March, but ongoing contributions of low-level international and 
interprovincial transmission throughout 2020.  
 
We aggregated the results by province and by season in order to evaluate the relative 
contributions of sampled transmission attributable to within-province, interprovincial, USA, and 
other international. As the border closure occurred on 18 March 2020, a few days before the 
advent of spring 2020, comparing winter and spring 2020 permits the analysis of whether that 
intervention was effective in reducing importations. The contribution of within-province 
transmission steadily increased over time for all provinces, coinciding with a reduction, but not 
an elimination, in the relative contributions of USA, other international, and interprovincial 
transmission sources over time (Fig. S16). However, if we look at the total number of sampled 
transmission events traced to international origins instead of the proportion (Fig. 5), there was 
an increase in the number of detected transmission events traced to USA or other international 
sources between winter and spring 2020 for all provinces. It was not until the summer of 2020 
that there was a marked reduction in international transmission (in provinces with samples 
available, excluding British Columbia, Alberta, and the Maritime provinces). Again, this finding is 
limited by the availability of sequences across provinces. Ontario and Manitoba were the only 
provinces to consistently deposit sequences across all seasons and therefore have the highest 
confidence. Results from fall 2020 and winter 2021 should be interpreted cautiously as the lag 
between sample collection and sequence deposition on GISAID has been variably lengthy48 
 
Interprovincial transmission was further evaluated by comparing inferred transmission 
origins among Canadian sequences with a Canadian parental node from another province (Fig. 
5), where it is evident that Ontario and Quebec were the greatest sampled sources of 
interprovincial transmission, and British Columbia acted as a notable transmission source to 
Manitoba in spring 2020 (Fig. 5c). For each province, the net transmission was calculated as the 
difference in sampled transmission events where each province was inferred as the source or 
the recipient. Quebec and British Columbia were the greatest net sources of transmission (Fig. 
5d), however this result is uncertain due to poor data availability. Specific province comparisons 
revealed contrasting source-sink dynamics; for example, there were more inferred transmission 
events from Alberta to British Columbia than from British Columbia to Alberta. The extent of 
mixing between Canadian provinces is illustrated by numerous sublineages comprised of 
sequences from multiple provinces (Fig. 2). Finally, we evaluated whether the proportion of all 
importations resulting in domestic transmission (i.e. a Canadian sublineage) rather than a 
singleton changed significantly over time. By binning these events by season and summing by 
province of introduction (Fig. S13a) or origin location (Fig. S13b), we were able to compare the 
distributions of proportions using a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test (p=0.58). The winter 2021 
season was removed from the analysis due to low sequence availability. Contrary to our 
expectations, the proportion of importations resulting in a sublineage did not significantly change 
over the course of 2020.

Discussion 
Our analyses revealed that Canadian travel restrictions imposed in March 2020 to limit the
COVID-19 burden reduced but did not eliminate international seeding of SARS-CoV-2 into
Canada throughout 2020. Furthermore, unhampered interprovincial travel of infectious
Canadians further contributed to ongoing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between provinces.
There were significant reductions in sublineages’ detection lag, adjusted for province, and
number of sampled descendants over time, suggesting that contact tracing and outbreak control
did somewhat improve over the course of the pandemic. However, the proportion of
importations resulting in ongoing domestic sublineages did not change over time, indicating that
more could have been done to stop new viral introductions from igniting outbreaks. Although
non-essential international travel was restricted on 18 March 2020, repatriation of Canadians
and domestic travel contributed to the continued spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Canada.

Discrete ancestral trait reconstruction is sensitive to sampling bias, causing ancestral 
nodes to be more likely to share the states predominant among tips. We reduced sampling bias 
by subsampling sequences by countries’ proportional contribution to global diagnoses in each 
month. This method, however, is sensitive to differences in countries’ contact-tracing efforts, 
testing strategies, and case reporting. Further, while subsampling can effectively reduce 
overrepresentation of geographies that contributed a higher proportion of sequences than 
proportion of new diagnoses, such as the UK, this method does not directly improve 
representation of geographies that are undersampled in the sequence database. Since we had 
a priori knowledge from Worobey et al.1 that Iran and Italy were undersampled early in the 
COVID pandemic, yet played a key role as sources of infection, we were able to designate 
sequences from individuals who had travelled to those countries as originating from those 
countries, this was relatively ad hoc and not possible in the absence of travel data. Incorporating 
individuals’ travel history when available, as demonstrated by Lemey et al.49, or flight volume 
data5 could help to improve representation of otherwise undersampled geographies. Our 
analyses are limited to that which was measured and shared publicly. 
 
Differences in sequence sharing across Canadian provinces over time added uncertainty 
to our results. Large gaps in publicly shared genomes, where for instance no sequences from 
British Columbia are available for summer 2020 (Table S1), make these analyses challenging to 
execute and interpret appropriately, particularly when it comes to comparing provinces’ relative 
international importations as well as temporal trends for a given province. We expect that our 
ancestral reconstruction was more robust to origin location than provinces of introduction due to 
differences in provinces’ sequence deposition. Additionally, the deposition of Canadian SARS-
CoV-2 sequences with incomplete sampling dates presented a computational challenge that 
could have been abrogated by open data sharing. While protecting patient privacy and 
confidentiality is important, it is unlikely that release of a sampling date associated with a viral 
genetic sequence would result in re-identification of any individual. The added computational 
time and parallelization required to simultaneously infer incomplete sample dates for thousands 
of tips while estimating a relaxed molecular clock during time-scaled tree conversion using 
LDS2 was not insignificant, and added unnecessary uncertainty into the phylogeny and clock 
estimation. Meanwhile, nearly all the other nations in the world sharing SARS-CoV-2 sequences 
have shared full sample collection dates, and Japan recently added >15,000 complete dates to 
previously submitted sequences with incomplete dates on GISAID. Canada was ranked 83rd 
compared to other nations for the proportion of genomes with complete sample collection dates 
(around 1/3) and 80th in the average delay between sample collection and release of genome 
data, with an average of 168 days passed between sample collection and sequence release48. 
Overall, these inconsistencies create unnecessary burdens to interpreting patterns across 
provinces and time. Improvements in reporting sequence dates and closing the gap between 
sequencing and reporting would enhance public health in Canada during this, but also future, 
pandemics. 
 
Seeing as the Canadian virus genomes available only represent a small proportion of 
diagnosed cases (1.05% overall) and an even smaller proportion when taking into consideration 
undiagnosed cases47, our estimates of the number of importations are severely underestimated. 
Larger sublineages are more likely to be well-represented than smaller sublineages, and a 
proportion of the singletons were likely part of local transmission networks that were unsampled. 
Furthermore, separate chains of transmission with identical viral genomes could lead to 
grouping sequences that were in fact independent introductions that could not be disentangled, 
further underestimating the number of introductions. An additional consideration in the 
interpretation of sublineages as independent introductions is the possibility that seemingly 
distinct sublineages were the result of a single introduction that circulated within Canada for 
enough generations to have accumulated at least one mutation to distinguish them before they

were detected by sequencing efforts. This would lead to an overestimate of the number of 
independent introductions. 
 
Another source of sampling bias worth considering is that sequences were more likely to 
be generated for patients with low cycle threshold values, due to a higher viral load. This could 
bias the analysis towards viruses from individuals who were sampled at the peak of their 
infectious period or who experienced more severe symptoms, whereas individuals sampled too 
early or late in their infection or who had a low viral load throughout might not be represented. If 
we assume that individuals with a higher viral load are more infectious50,51, then their 
contribution to the transmission network would be greater, justifying their relative 
overrepresentation in genomic epidemiological analyses.  
 
Overall, it was not surprising that the USA was the greatest source of SARS-CoV-2 
importations into Canada considering our shared land border – the longest in the world - and 
close trade relationships. What was concerning, however, was our inference of ongoing 
importations from the USA even after restricting non-essential international travel. In light of 
wide variations in provinces’ COVID intervention stringency and duration21, it is unsurprising that 
many Canadians and non-residents continued to travel internationally throughout 2020 and 
early 202152. Additional ongoing importations from the UK, Russia, and India, among others, 
further indicates that there is room for improvement to better enforce quarantine, testing, and 
contact tracing upon return to Canada for essential workers and non-essential travellers alike. 
One consideration would be to enforce (affordable and subsidized) mandatory 14-day hotel 
quarantine upon first landing, as in Australia and New Zealand, removing the possibility of 
transmission during domestic connecting flights, public transport, and interactions with family 
and community members while in self-isolation. While the majority of importations were inferred 
to have been introduced into Ontario, this is partially attributable to the consistent sequence 
deposition over time from Ontario. It is also worth noting that the majority of Canadian 
sequences deposited into the public domain without incomplete sample collection dates came 
from Ontario. By 11 February 2021, Quebec had deposited a single sequence since September 
2020 and Alberta had deposited one since May 2020. Based on provincial population sizes 
alone, we would expect most importations into Ontario and Quebec (with populations of 14.8M 
and 8.6M, respectively) than into British Columbia (5.2M), Alberta (4.5M), or other provinces 
and territories with less than 1.5M53. 
 
Consistent with the findings from the UK and NZ, which found that transmission lineages 
generally became smaller5  over time, we found a significant reduction in the number of sampled 
descendants of Canadian sublineages over time. We note, however, that this result could be 
affected by the delay in depositing sequence data for more recent sublineages. We additionally 
found that the detection lag was significantly lower over time, adjusting for province of 
introduction, and that the longer the detection lag, the more sampled descendants there were. 
This is intuitive as interruption of further transmission through contact tracing, case isolation, 
and testing, is dependent upon detecting the transmission chain in the first place. Our results 
therefore corroborate the importance of timely public health interventions. 
 
Our analysis of whether there were temporal changes in the proportion of importations 
resulting in ongoing transmission, as opposed to singletons, was somewhat underpowered to 
detect any significant changes over time. Within Ontario, the proportion increases into fall 2020, 
serving as further evidence that enforcement and/or compliance of the 14-day quarantine upon 
returning to Canada did not improve over time. Notably, singletons may simply reflect a lack of 
sequences representing downstream domestic transmission, not true evolutionary dead ends. 
Therefore, we expect that the proportion of importations resulting in ongoing transmission are 
underestimates, particularly in seasons where few to no sequences are available from certain 
provinces.

We anticipate that the recent rise of VOCs in Canada has been the result of multiple 
introductions of B.1.1.7, P.1, B.1.351, and we look forward to these sequences being shared 
with complete dates, empowering Canadian researchers to contribute to our understanding and 
response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
Conclusions 
Our phylogeographic analyses illuminated the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic in 
Canada was perpetuated by ongoing international importations and interprovincial transmission 
throughout 2020. Although travel restrictions enacted in March 2020 reduced the importation 
rate and proportion of transmission from abroad across all Canadian provinces, SARS-CoV-2 
introductions from the USA, India, Russia, and other nations were detectable through the 
summer and fall of 2020. We provide evidence supporting that public health responses led to a 
modest reduction of imported sublineages’ size and detection lag over time. 
 
Understanding SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in response to public health 
interventions can inform their effectiveness in diminishing ongoing transmission. Sharing viral 
genome sequences linked with the time and place of sampling in a timely manner is of utmost 
importance for public health; doing so enables epidemic surveillance for new and already 
described variants of concern, analyses to support contact tracing, and the inference of the 
timing and routes of SARS-CoV-2 migration, which can inform the effectiveness of public health 
interventions.

Fig. S3. The relationship between total number of diagnoses and total number of representative
sequences in the dataset by country a) before and b) after subsampling global sequences relative to their
case contributions. The average sequence representation is the total number of sequences from a
country divided by the total number of COVID-19 diagnoses. This analysis excludes countries for which
there were zero sequences available.  
 
Fig. S4. From the initially inferred FastTree phylogeny, temporal outliers (sequences that may contain
excessive sequencing errors) were removed from the clock signal if a) tips residual value from the linear

pendent edges (branch preceding tip) exceeded 12 mutations. The clock signal fit improved from c) the
pre-trimmed tree, and d) the final tree excluding temporal outliers. The mean substitution rate was
estimated to be 7.58e-4 subs/site/year.

Fig. S10. Inferred dates for 2,168 Canadian sequences that were annotated with incomplete sample
collection dates containing only year and month. The blue points are the most likely LSD2-inferred date
and the light blue lines show the 95% confidence interval (estimated using 100 bootstraps). The LSD-
inferred dates were used to estimate the detection lag between the tMRCA and sample collection date. In
instances where LSD output an estimated upper confidence date as only ‘2021’, we ascribed them
arbitrarily as 15 January 2021.

Fig. S11. The detection lag (dotted line) was calculated as the number of days between the date of most
recent common ancestor (diamond) and first Canadian sample collection date (square) for each
sublineage, followed by subsequently detected descendant sample collection dates (circles), linked by
solid line. The uncertainty in tMRCA and inferred sample dates was omitted for conciseness.

Fig. S12. Evaluating relationships between the a) detection lag and province, b) detection lag and
tMRCA, c) number of sampled descendants and tMRCA, and d) detection lag and number of sampled
descendants, adjusted by province. Where detection lag was the outcome, linear models were used;
where number of sampled descendants was the outcome, negative binomial models were used. The
detection lag was calculated as the number of days between the first Canadian sample collection date
and the date of the most recent common ancestor for each sublineage.

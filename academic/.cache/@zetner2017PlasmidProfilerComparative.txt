Plasmid Profiler: Comparative analysis of plasmid content 
Abstract 
13 
Summary: Comparative analysis of bacterial plasmids from whole genome sequence (WGS) 
14 
data generated from short read sequencing is challenging. This is due to the difficulty in 
15 
identifying contigs harbouring plasmid sequence data, and further difficulty in assembling such 
16 
contigs into a full plasmid. As such, few software programs and bioinformatics pipelines exist to 
17 
perform comprehensive comparative analyses of plasmids within and amongst sequenced 
18 
isolates. To address this gap, we have developed Plasmid Profiler, a pipeline to perform 
19 
comparative plasmid content analysis without the need for de novo assembly. The pipeline is 
20 
designed to rapidly identify plasmid sequences by mapping reads to a plasmid reference 
21 
sequence database. Predicted plasmid sequences are then annotated with their incompatibility 
22 
group, if known. The pipeline allows users to query plasmids for genes or regions of interest and 
23 
visualize results as an interactive heat map.

Plasmid Profiler: Comparative analysis of plasmid content 
1. Introduction 
53 
 Plasmids are circular or linear extrachromosomal double-stranded DNA molecules 
54 
capable of self-replication in a host and transfer between host cells. They are highly variable 
55 
both in length (from one to several hundred kilobases) and number of copies per cell with many 
56 
plasmids harboring genes beneficial to host fitness and pathogenicity. These genes confer 
57 
benefits like antimicrobial resistance (AMR), organic product degradation, and virulence factors 
58 
such as toxin production. Carriage and transfer of pathogenicity and AMR determinants makes 
59 
development of epidemiologically relevant tools and plasmid classification systems important 
60 
health care research topics. It was to these ends that in response to a multi-species plasmid-
61 
mediated drug-resistant outbreak Plasmid Profiler was developed to explore and visualize 
62 
cellular plasmid content directly from whole genome sequencing short reads.  
63 
The backbone of a given plasmid contains genes essential to its maintenance and stable 
64 
inheritance (Nordstrom,K. and Austin,S.J. 1989, Shintani,M., Sanchez,Z.K., et al. 2015). This 
65 
gives rise to one common method of plasmid classification driven by the concept of incompatibly 
66 
grouping where two plasmids with the same incompatibility group cannot replicate within the 
67 
same cell. These groups are defined by the plasmids replication or equipartitioning systems 
68 
(Couturier,M., Bex,F., et al. 1988). Currently, we are able to screen for 116 incompatibility 
69 
groups and subgroups based on the sequences within the Enterobacteriaceae plasmid typing 
70 
database provided by PlasmidFinder (Carattoli,A., Zankari,E., et al. 2014).  
71 
The role of plasmids in health and disease makes them important to characterize; 
72 
however, due to their structure it is stubbornly difficult to do so. Extensive mosaicism, repetitive 
73 
sequences, and smaller mobile elements (eg. transposons) within plasmids collectively impede 
74 
the ability to discriminate between plasmid and chromosomal DNA in whole genome 
75 
sequencing (WGS) data analysis.

Plasmid Profiler: Comparative analysis of plasmid content 
Without resorting to long-read sequencing, assembling a full plasmid sequence from 
77 
short reads is difficult and success not guaranteed even when used in conjunction with mate-
78 
pair technologies (Lynch,T., Petkau,A., et al. 2016). Some software packages have made 
79 
attempts to address plasmid analysis from short read sequencing data including PLACNET 
80 
(Lanza,V.F., de Toro,M., et al. 2014), Recycler (Rozov,R., Brown Kav,A., et al. 2016), 
81 
plasmidSPAdes (Antipov,D., Hartwick,N., et al. 2016), PlasmidFinder (Carattoli,A., Zankari,E., et 
82 
al. 2014), but regretfully to date no system has been shown to be capable of reliably 
83 
reconstructing plasmids (Arredondo-Alonso,S., van Schaik,W., et al. 2017, Orlek,A., 
84 
Stoesser,N., et al. 2017). Accordingly, there is a scarcity of software available to explore the 
85 
unassembled plasmid content of bacterial short-read WGS data. We have developed the 
86 
Plasmid Profiler pipeline to explore plasmid content without having to resort to the time-
87 
consuming and unreliable de novo assembly process.  
88 
2. Methods 
89 
Plasmid Profiler is implemented as a Galaxy workflow and operates as follows: 
90 
1. Three inputs are required: WGS short reads in FastQ format, the supplied 
91 
plasmid sequence database, and the supplied but user-modifiable replicon sequence and 
92 
gene of interest database. The plasmid sequence database originates as a multi-fasta file 
93 
from NCBI starting with all Gammaproteobacteria plasmid sequences (n=2797, size range: 
94 
1065-727,905 bp). Database curation was performed by first removing redundancy using CD-
95 
HIT (v.4.6) (Fu,L., Niu,B., et al. 2012, Li,W. and Godzik,A. 2006) to cluster sequences at >99% 
96 
sequence identity and >99% length, then identify a representative sequence from each cluster. 
97 
All sequences containing the following annotation keywords: “draft”, “contig”, “scaffold”, “partial”, 
98 
“incomplete”, and “putative” were removed to avoid incomplete and low quality plasmid 
99 
sequence data. The database was then formatted for SRST2 using the Python scripts included 
100 
.

doi: 
bioRxiv preprint 
Plasmid Profiler: Comparative analysis of plasmid content 
in the SRST2 distribution. The user-modifiable replicon and genes of interest database is a 
101 
multi-fasta file with plasmid replicon sequences from PlasmidFinder (Center for Genomic 
102 
Epidemiology’s PlasmidFinder database available at: https://cge.cbs.dtu.dk//services/data.php) 
103 
along with user-defined nucleotide sequences for genes of interest. These three elements are 
104 
then passed to the tools of the workflow. 
105 
2. KAT (v. 2.3.1) (Mapleson,D., Garcia Accinelli,G., et al. 2017) removes 
106 
unrepresented Gammaproteobacteria plasmid sequences to create an individualized 
107 
plasmid database per sample. As a measure to increase speed and efficiency, a customized 
108 
database is created for each WGS isolate to contain only sequences moderately homologous to 
109 
the isolate’s sequence data. This per isolate database reduction step is accomplished using 
110 
KAT to compare the k-mers of each isolate’s WGS reads to a series of k-mer hashes derived 
111 
from the entire Gammaproteobacteria plasmid database. Database sequences which are 
112 
represented at a minimum of 80% by the k-mers of a particular WGS isolate are retained in that 
113 
isolate’s individual plasmid database and all other sequences discarded. This process rapidly 
114 
creates individual databases for each WGS sample and avoids the memory intensive and time 
115 
consuming mapping process to references unrepresented in an isolate’s WGS reads.  
116 
3. SRST2 (v.0.1.6) (Inouye,M., Dashnow,H., et al. 2014) identifies putative plasmid 
117 
hits from the individual databases. SRST2 is a software package that allows for in silico 
118 
sequence typing of WGS data based on the mapping of short sequence reads to a custom gene 
119 
and/or allele database. Paired or single end reads are mapped with Bowtie2 (Langmead,B. and 
120 
Salzberg,S.L. 2012) and the resulting pileups scored according to sequence coverage and 
121 
divergence. Plasmid Profiler replaces the SRST2 gene database with the curated plasmid 
122 
database from Step 1. At this stage of the pipeline, SRST2 is run using the “Custom Virulence 
123 
Database” parameter with the individualized plasmid databases serving as the SRST2 database 
124 
for their respective isolate.

Plasmid Profiler: Comparative analysis of plasmid content 
4. BLAST+ (v 2.2.31) (Camacho,C., Coulouris,G., et al. 2009) identifies the 
126 
incompatibility groups and genes of interest found in the high scoring sequences from 
127 
step 3. Plasmid sequences identified with SRST2 are used to create a custom BLAST database 
128 
against which 116 plasmid replicon sequences (Center for Genomic Epidemiology’s 
129 
PlasmidFinder database available at: https://cge.cbs.dtu.dk//services/data.php) are queried 
130 
using MegaBLAST (Morgulis,A., Coulouris,G., et al. 2008). Included in the query were the 
131 
coding sequences for user-specified genes of interest (eg. AMR genes). The query sequences 
132 
(PlasmidFinder replicons + AMR) are presented in a multi-FASTA file with AMR genes or genes 
133 
of interest appended to the end, prefixed with the tag “(AMR)”. Five carbapenemase genes are 
134 
included in the default database as examples to be modified or replaced as the user decides. 
135 
Only the best hit per plasmid is displayed on the final heat map. 
136 
5. The Plasmid Profiler R package parses and visualizes the results of steps 2-4. 
137 
The following steps are completed using a series of functions written in the R programming 
138 
language and published in the Plasmid Profiler R package which is available through CRAN. 
139 
The percent ID (PID) of each BLAST hit is adjusted by multiplying it by the ratio of query to hit 
140 
length to compensate for hits with high PID but incomplete sequence coverage. Hits of less than 
141 
80% adjusted PID are discarded. Each identified plasmid is labelled with its associated 
142 
incompatibility group (if no match is found then this is reported as “-“) and presence/absence of 
143 
the user-specified genes of interest (eg. AMR genes). Sureness values are calculated for each 
144 
sample from the sum of sequence coverage (normalized over the range 0 to 1) and sequence 
145 
divergence (normalized over the range -1 to 0). This measure is then normalized over the range 
146 
0 to 1. The Sureness values are used to create a distance matrix upon which hierarchical 
147 
clustering using complete linkage is applied creating a dendrogram and determining the 
148 
ordering of isolates on the resulting plot. This dendrogram reveals the similarity of putative 
149 
plasmid content in the samples examined. A tile geometry is plotted using ggplot2 (v2.1.0)

Users can run the pipeline locally through a standalone Galaxy (Afgan,E., Baker,D., et 
165 
al. 2016) instance in a Docker container (Boettiger,C. 2015). Alternatively, users can install the 
166 
galaxy pipeline and tools to a pre-existing Galaxy instance from the Galaxy Toolshed 
167 
(https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/) (Blankenberg,D., Von Kuster,G., et al. 2014). The R related 
168 
portion of the analysis is available as a conda recipe and as a package from the Comprehensive 
169 
R Archive Network (CRAN) that can be easily installed to a local R instance for further 
170 
manipulation of the mapping output.  
171 
3. Conclusion 
172 
Plasmid Profiler is a useful comparative tool for visualization of plasmid content in WGS data 
173 
from bacterial isolates without resorting to difficult and uncertain assembly methods or the use 
174 
of long-read sequencing technologies. It addresses a gap in current plasmid-mediated outbreak 
175 
analysis methods where an overview of plasmids and antimicrobial resistance genes within a 
176 
collection of isolates is difficult to obtain. Although the tool is limited by plasmids present in the 
177 
database, identification and visualization of plasmid backbones within outbreak organisms is 
178 
important to understanding and conveying the full context of an outbreak.

Background: Many countries have attempted to miti-
gate and control COVID-19 through non-pharma-
ceutical interventions, particularly with the aim of 
reducing population movement and contact. However, 
it remains unclear how the different control strategies 
impacted the local phylodynamics of the causative 
SARS-CoV-2 virus. Aim: We aimed to assess the dura-
tion of chains of virus transmission within individual 
countries and the extent to which countries exported 
viruses to their geographical neighbours. Methods: 
We analysed complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes to infer 
the relative frequencies of virus importation and 
exportation, as well as virus transmission dynamics, 
in countries of northern Europe. We examined virus 
evolution and phylodynamics in Denmark, Finland, 
Iceland, Norway and Sweden during the first year of 
the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: The Nordic coun-
tries differed markedly in the invasiveness of control 
strategies, which we found reflected in transmission 
chain dynamics. For example, Sweden, which com-
pared with the other Nordic countries relied more on 
recommendation-based rather than legislation-based 
mitigation interventions, had transmission chains that 
were more numerous and tended to have more cases. 
This trend increased over the first 8 months of 2020. 
Together with Denmark, Sweden was a net exporter of 
SARS-CoV-2. Norway and Finland implemented legis-
lation-based interventions; their transmission chain 
dynamics were in stark contrast to their neighbour-
ing country Sweden. Conclusion: Sweden constituted 
an epidemiological and evolutionary refugium that 
enabled the virus to maintain active transmission and 
spread to other geographical locations. Our analysis 
reveals the utility of genomic surveillance where moni-
toring of active transmission chains is a key metric.
Introduction
Following its initial description in December 2019, 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  2 
(SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus dis-
ease (COVID-19) [1,2], rapidly led to a major global pub-
lic health event. Until 18 October 2021, the pandemic 
has caused more than 240 million infections and over 
4.9 million deaths worldwide and had a significant 
impact on healthcare systems, societies and the global 
economy. Countries were struggling with how to effec-
tively counteract the pandemic, balancing the protec-
tion of health with social and economic considerations. 
During the first year of the pandemic, in the absence 
of specific therapies and vaccines, efforts centred on 
non-pharmaceutical interventions, including initial 
short-term and large-scale restrictions to population 
movement (e.g. lockdowns), increased testing and vari-
ous levels of physical distancing. Analysing local epi-
demiological consequences of control strategies, via 
their reflection in the short-term evolutionary dynam-
ics of the virus, provides key information on the most 
effective approaches to reduce rates of transmission 
during emerging viral epidemics.
The Nordic countries, defined here as Denmark, 
Finland, Norway, Iceland and Sweden, provide an 
example of geographically, politically and socially 
related countries that employed different COVID-19

control strategies. Responses differed markedly during 
the first 6 months of the pandemic before becoming 
more similar in the following 6 months, which offered 
a natural comparison within and between Nordic coun-
tries. Sweden initially took a less restrictive approach 
based on recommendations, compared with legislative 
approaches in the other Nordic countries. In Sweden, 
recommendation-based measures did not enforce gen-
eral population movement restrictions, schools for chil-
dren younger than 16 years remained open, mandatory 
quarantine was not imposed for infected households 
and businesses continued to operate with adapta-
tion to distancing limitations [3]. In contrast, Norway, 
Finland and Denmark imposed more invasive popu-
lation movement restrictions that included enforced 
home office for workers in the public sector, schooling 
at home, targeted closure of businesses in the private 
sector, closing of restaurants, museums, sports cen-
tres, etc., as well as closed international borders for 
non-residents. Iceland, a small homogenous island 
population (of ca 350,000) never initiated population 
movement restrictions such as Norway, Denmark and 
Finland, but rather focused on large-scale testing and 
contact tracing to limit virus spread within the commu-
nity. In relation to population size, Sweden has had a 
higher number of COVID19-related cases and deaths

than the other Nordic countries [4,5], with a cumulative 
incidence of around 9,758 cases and 137 deaths per 
100,000 people, compared with around 4,465 cases 
and 43 deaths in Denmark, 2,169 cases and 14 deaths 
in Norway, 1,608 cases and 17 deaths in Finland, and 
1,790 cases and eight deaths in Iceland, by 2 May 2021 
[6]; most cases occurred between April and July 2020 
and between November 2020 to March 2021.
Although the relative success of COVID-19 control 
measures is normally gauged by the number of cases 
and deaths at the country level, interventions and 
mitigation strategies may lead to marked differences 
in transmission dynamics among populations, which 
are in turn reflected in the phylogenetic relationships 
between virus isolates. Using a comparative analysis of 
genome sequence data we addressed whether the dif-
ferent approaches to COVID-19 control employed by the 
Nordic countries resulted in differences in virus trans-
mission dynamics. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence data 
also allowed us to explore the relative frequencies of 
virus importation/exportation (i.e. virus phylodynam-
ics) during the first year (January 2020 to March 2021) 
of the pandemic. Accordingly, we compiled an exten-
sive dataset of SARS-CoV-2 virus genomes and per-
formed a phylo-epidemiological study to identify any 
differences in transmission chain dynamics between 
these countries.
Methods
Dataset construction
We downloaded all SARS-CoV-2 genomes that were 
complete and had high sequencing coverage available 
on 22 March 2021 at the GISAID platform (www.gisaid.
org). We selected all sequences from the five Nordic 
countries: 50,126 from Denmark, 2,374 from Finland, 
4,167 from Iceland, 3,388 from Norway, and 7,863 
from Sweden). To obtain a representative subset of the 
global diversity, we also selected 3,437 genomes from 
the latest NextStrain global build on 22 March 2021 [7].
Sequencing intensity was markedly different between 
countries, with Denmark and Iceland sequencing 
around 22% and 68%, respectively of reported cases. 
In Norway, Finland and Sweden, the sequencing inten-
sity was 4%, 3% and 1.1%, respectively, during our 
period of sampling (Table). We attempted to control for 
such sampling bias by subsampling genomes relative 
to the Nordic country with the lowest sampling inten-
sity. This means that all countries were sampled at a 
rate relative to Sweden of 1.1 genomes per 100 cases. 
For this purpose, we divided the number of genomes 
from each country by the cumulative number of cases 
reported in each country by mid-March 2021, as 
recorded in ourworldindata.org [8]. We repeated this 
procedure 10 times, and in each obtained a sequence 
alignment with all data from NextStrain and with the 
number of genomes from the Nordic countries propor-
tional to the prevalence of the virus (Table). The com-
plete dataset consisted of 71,355 genomes, 67,918 of 
them from the Nordic countries. Our 10 alignments with 
equal sequencing intensity for the Nordic countries had 
between 15,616 and 15,297 sequences (i.e. between 
12,179 and 11,860 Nordic genomes, plus the 3,437 
from the NextStrain build). The GISAID accession num-
bers and details of all sequences included in the final 
sequence alignment are available in  Supplementary 
Table S1.
Estimating a time-scaled phylogenetic tree
We estimated maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees 
using IQ-TREE v2.0.6 [9] employing the GTR + Γ model 
of nucleotide substitution [10]. We fit a strict molecu-
lar clock to the data using LSDv0.3 [11]. We calibrated 
the molecular clock by specifying the sequence 
sampling times and fixing the evolutionary rate to 
1 × 10− 3  nucleotide substitutions per site per year as 
estimated previously [12]. We chose this approach 
because testing for temporal signal and fitting a 
sophisticated molecular clock model is not feasible for 
a dataset of this size. For a small number of sequences 
(n = 113; 0.16% of the complete dataset) only the 
month and year were available, therefore we assigned 
them the 15th of the corresponding month.
Detection of virus transmission chains
We defined transmission chains as monophyletic 
groups of genomes (at least two) collected from one of 
the Nordic countries, which is analogous to transmis-
sion lineages as defined previously [13]. We computed 
key statistics from each transmission chain, specifi-
cally: the duration (i.e. the length of time in days from 
the first to the last collected genome), the size (i.e. the 
number of genomes) and the time of origin (i.e. the 
time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA)). 
For each country, we also calculated an Ht-index of 
transmission chains, where Ht  is the largest number 
of transmission chains with at least Ht  cases. Larger 
values reflect an increase in the number and size of 
lineages. Because we subsampled the data 10 times 
(Supplementary Figure S1), we computed the range 
of values for these statistics, as a crude measure of 
uncertainty due to sampling.
We fit linear regressions for transmission chain size 
against the detection date (the date of collection of the 
first genome within a transmission chain), such that 
positive trends would suggest increased community 
spread over time (i.e. larger transmission chains over 
time). We also regressed the duration of transmission 
chains against detection date, where a positive trend 
means that transmission chains detected later in the 
pandemic tended to last longer. Because the number 
of cases had substantially decreased around August 
2020, we fit our regressions across two periods: before 
and after 31 August 2020. Importantly, the end of 
August also preceded by a few months the emergence 
of the Alpha variant of SARS-CoV-2 (Phylogenetic 
Assignment of Named Global Outbreak (Pango) lineage 
designation B.1.1.7) and its introduction to the Nordic 
countries (Supplementary Figure S6). This variant of 
4

concern has been shown to have increased transmis-
sibility relative to circulating diversity [14]. We only 
report trends as residual distributions were strongly 
skewed.
Inferring virus migration dynamics between 
Nordic countries
To infer the frequency of importation or exportation 
events of SARS-CoV-2 between the Nordic countries, 
as well as from the rest of the world, we employed a 
Bayesian stochastic mapping approach, also known 
as discrete phylogeography, as implemented in BEAST 
v1.10.4 [15-17] using guidelines from Dellicour et al. for 
very large genomic datasets [18]. We fixed the time-
tree described above and assigned a geographical 
location for each tip, which could be either of the five 
Nordic countries or ‘other’ (for those collected in other 
countries). This method is broadly similar to that used 
to infer geographical movement of the virus in Belgium 
[12]. We repeated this procedure for the 10 subsam-
pled replicate trees and report median posterior val-
ues and ranges across replicates. Stochastic mapping

generates a posterior distribution of ‘type changes’ 
between locations along the branches.
We ran a Markov Monte Carlo chain with a length of 
5 × 107 steps, recording every 5,000th step. Sufficient 
sampling from the posterior was assessed by verifying 
that the effective sample size of all parameters was 
above 200 as estimated in Tracer v.1.7 [19]. We inferred 
the posterior number of migration events between the 
six possible states (Markov jumps) and the amount of 
time spent at each state, known as Markov rewards.
Assessing public health measures and 
governmental stringency
To provide an overview of public health measures 
taken and how they were enforced between February 
2020 and March 2021 per Nordic country, we plotted 
data from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response 
Tracker [20] which included: testing policy, contact trac-
ing, public information campaigns, international travel 
control, workplace closure, school closure, cancelation 
of public transportation, stay at home requirements, 
facemask usage, gathering restrictions, cancelation 
of public events, restrictions on movement and gov-
ernment stringency response index (Supplementary 
Figures S2–S5).

Ethical approval was not needed for this study. All the

Results
The estimated time of emergence of sampled trans-
mission chains provides information about the onset 
of community transmission, although such an asso-
ciation is sensitive to sampling bias, particularly the 
timescale of country-specific sequencing efforts. Our 
phylogenetic analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was 
imported to all Nordic countries between January and 
late February 2020, with detectable community trans-
mission from early February in Sweden and from early 
March in the other Nordic countries as inferred by the 
presence of transmission chains (Figure 1). Sustained 
community transmission continued for all Nordic coun-
tries beyond April 2020, with the exception of Iceland, 
which was characterised by a relatively short 1-month 
period of community transmission, and Norway, which 
had a low number of cases combined with a low 
sequencing intensity of 0.04 (Table).
The total number of exportation events was larger for 
Sweden (n = 552; range: 479–704) than for Denmark 
(n = 125; range: 98–203) (Table). Most exportation 
events from Sweden were into Finland, whereas those 
from Denmark were into non-Nordic countries, followed 
by Sweden and Iceland (Figure 2, panel B). An inspec-
tion of the amount of time in the tree occupied by each 
country, known as the Markov rewards, revealed that 
Sweden occupied the largest portion, consistent with it 
being the major exporter. In contrast, Norway, had very 
low Markov rewards, although it had more genomes 
than Iceland and Finland, both with higher Markov 
rewards (Supplementary Figure S8). 
The number of transmission chains observed had a 
mean of 227 (range: 197–231) for Denmark, 105 (range: 
94–119) for Norway, 86 (range: 79–103) for Finland and 
45 (range: 19–56) for Iceland. The highest number of 
transmission chains – 677 (range: 638–690) – was 
observed in Sweden. The median duration of such 
transmission chains (number of days from detection 
to last sampled case) was higher in Iceland (n = 45; 
range: 19–56) and Denmark (n = 42, range: 40–44) 
than other localities: 31 (range: 30–32) for Sweden, 26 
(range: 21–28) for Finland, and 25 (range: 23–27) for 
Norway (Table).
The largest transmission chain was found in Sweden, 
with 366 cases (range: 175–368), followed by Denmark 
with 228 (range: 99–243), Norway with 134 (range: 
129–147), Finland with 80 (range: 65–135) and 
Iceland with 44 (range: 34–56). Sweden had the high-
est Ht-index (Table). The Ht-index was 38 for Sweden 
(range: 36–39), 21 for Denmark (range: 20–22), 11 for 
Finland (range: 9–12), 11 for Norway (range: 10–12) and 
2 for Iceland (range: 2–3).
There was inconclusive evidence of an increase in 
transmission chain size in the first period (before 31 
August 2020) when between two and eight of 10 sub-
sampling replicates displayed a positive regression 
slope. Because sample size and number of data points 
in the second period were small, we did not perform a 
trend analysis for Iceland. After 31 August 2020, most 
replicates (nine or more) exhibited a negative trend 
for all countries, indicating a decrease in transmission 
chain size over time. Similarly, we did not find con-
sistent trends for the duration of transmission chains 
in the first period whereas in the second period; they 
appeared to decline over time, with at most one repli-
cate displaying a positive slope in Denmark, Finland, 
Norway and Sweden (Table, Figure 1).
Discussion
Until March 2021, Sweden experienced a greater num-
ber of COVID-19-related cases and deaths in relation 
to population size than the other Nordic countries [6]. 
Our genomic analysis shows that while SARS-CoV-2 
was imported to all Nordic countries during the same 
time period in early 2020, Sweden experienced more 
transmission chains which also tended to be larger, 
suggesting that Sweden had the least-interrupted com-
munity transmission and more established community 
transmission during the sampling period relative to the 
other Nordic countries. In all Nordic countries, the size 
of transmission chains and their duration decreased in 
the second time period examined here.
Denmark and Sweden acted as exporters of SARS-CoV-2 
to their Nordic neighbours. Conversely, Iceland, Norway 
and in particular Finland showed lower levels of virus 
exportation. At the same time, our analyses indicate 
6
www.eurosurveillance.org
that Finland was the main receiver of the exportations 
from Sweden, suggesting a near unidirectional mode of 
exportation between the two countries. It is important 
to note, however, that even with enforced recommen-
dations, one might also have to consider aspects of 
urbanisation (differing population density not only at 
country level but also regionally within the countries) 
and geographical location that vary in these countries. 
Importantly, Denmark and Sweden are transit countries 
and the latter has borders with three of the other four 
Nordic countries.
During the first 6 months of the pandemic, Sweden did 
not enforce community mobility restrictions. Instead, 
mitigation efforts included, for example, recommenda-
tions to maintain physical distancing, work from home, 
limiting sizes of social events and moving to distance 
education for students above 16 years (Supplementary 
Table S2). Conversely, Denmark, Finland and Norway 
enforced population movement restrictions in their 
communities, closure of borders and government-
run facilities [4]. These mitigation efforts were taken 
during both the first and second pandemic wave 
(Supplementary Table S2, Supplementary Figures S2–
S5). During the second wave, which started in early 
September 2020 in the Nordic countries, Sweden addi-
tionally recommended limiting the number of people 
who meet within social circles and going into voluntary 
home-based quarantine if experiencing COVID-19-like 
symptoms. In early 2021, Sweden also recommended 
the use of protective face masks in public spaces, ca 
5–6 months after a corresponding recommendation in 
the other Nordic countries. In Norway, locally-based 
contact tracing supported by a national contact trac-
ing team, testing, isolation and quarantining has been 
the primary strategy since the summer of 2020. In con-
trast, the Danish strategy focused on extensive testing 
that was free-of-charge with readily accessible testing 
units (Supplementary Figure S2). Norway, Finland and 
Denmark enforced local contact-reducing measures 
during periods of outbreaks. Iceland, in a similar man-
ner to South Korea, used large-scale testing and contact 
tracing combined with physical distancing and volun-
tary home-based quarantine without the need to regu-
late population movement (see also  Supplementary 
Table S2) [21].
Overall, our results suggest that stringent public health 
interventions in the second period may have limited 
the spread of existing transmission chains. Thus, the 
increased number of cases in the second half of 2020 
was most probably driven by virus importations that 
did not lead to transmission chains of increasing size 
and duration. This is consistent with the fact that the

majority of importation events leading to transmis-
sion chains or singletons occurred in the second half 
of 2020 for most countries (Supplementary Figure S7). 
Thus, while regulating population movement appears 
to be an efficient method to reduce community trans-
mission [22,23], other mitigation efforts are also viable 
options under certain circumstances.
Norway experienced comparatively low numbers of 
transmission chains during the first 6 months of the 
pandemic. The bulk of detected transmission chains 
emerged in mid-April and towards the end of July 2020. 
However, this might in part reflect a delayed start of 
genome sequencing, which has increased substantially 
in all countries since that time, and such results should 
therefore be interpreted with caution. Indeed, we note 
that the sequencing intensity of cases in Norway was 
lower than in some of the other Nordic countries with 
similar case burdens. Thus, sequencing proportion 
bias per country needs to be taken into account when 
considering our results. To reduce effect of sequencing 
bias, we attempted to subsample our data to obtain 
even sequencing proportions. Nevertheless, data sub-
sampling does not correct for other sources of bias, 
such as the decision to sample close contacts of a pos-
itive case for sequencing or not. When sample size per 
country increases with time, the effect of such poten-
tial sampling biases is expected to decrease.
Our results indicate that Sweden’s mitigation strategy 
had an impact on the epidemiological situation inter-
nally and across the Nordic region as a whole. Sweden 
received considerable attention for the number of 
deaths reported. The country had one of the longest 
durations of excess deaths and the highest case num-
bers between February and May 2020 [5] that particu-
larly affected the population above 60 years of age 
[24]. The causes and mechanisms as to why Sweden 
experienced comparatively high periodic excess death 
will need to be studied carefully. Kamerlin et al. sug-
gested that a greater level of self-isolation would prob-
ably have reduced the number of deaths in Sweden 
[25].
The effect of closing/opening schools is also likely to 
have contributed to the transmission dynamics [26,27]. 
In the case of the Nordic countries, it can be argued that 
by closing pre-, primary and secondary schools, as well 
as higher education for several weeks during the spring 
of 2020 (Supplementary Table S2, Supplementary 
Figure S3), Denmark, Finland and Norway also reduced 
contact and virus transmission in the adult population 
to a greater extent than Sweden. In Sweden, schools 
remained open for children younger than 16 years dur-
ing the same period. However, although Sweden exhib-
ited a greater number of cases than the other Nordic 
countries and our results are consistent with periodi-
cally higher community transmission in Sweden com-
pared with the other Nordic Countries during the first 
12 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, higher commu-
nity transmission does not necessarily imply a causal 
relationship with excess deaths. While we employ a 
robust genomic-based modelling approach to study 
transmission chain changes, equating, or directly relat-
ing, such changes with the number of deaths may lead 
to incorrect conclusions as we have not taken into 
account any patient-related epidemiological param-
eters such as sex or age. Furthermore, it has also been 
argued that the larger number of deaths during the early 
phase of the pandemic in Sweden may have been influ-
enced by how admission criteria to intensive care units 
were applied, particularly for the elderly population 
in care homes at that time [25]. Thus, official mitiga-
tion strategies and efforts alone are unlikely to explain 
epidemiological differences between countries, which 
were also impacted by practical enforcement and the 
compliance from the general public, businesses and 
healthcare providers. In addition, vaccinations began 
in late December 2020 for all Nordic countries, initially 
focusing on people older than 70 years and identified 
risk groups. At our last sampling date (22 March 2021), 
between 9.5% and 13% of the population had been 
partially vaccinated in these countries and less than 
5.5% of the population in each country had been fully 
vaccinated [8]. It is therefore unlikely that the onset of 
vaccination had any significant impact on our analyses.
A critical issue, albeit one that has received little 
attention, is that if transmission chains are allowed to 
remain active, they also provide increased opportu-
nity for the virus to evolve and adapt to local popula-
tions, potentially acquiring mutations that in some way 
enhance fitness. Indeed, several variants of concern 
have independently emerged globally, with mutations 
that are associated with epidemiologically important 
properties. For example, the Alpha variant acquired 
mutations that significantly increased transmission 
potential [14] and the Beta variant (B.1.351) exhibited 
increased resistance against vaccines [28]. Clearly, 
mutations routinely appear in the SARS-CoV-2 genome 
[29], and it is important to continuously evaluate their 
functional relevance.
In addition to providing increased evolutionary poten-
tial, sustained transmission chains also provide epi-
demiological refugia from which the virus can be 
transmitted to other localities. This is in line with our 
results showing that Sweden had a greater frequency of 
exportation events among neighbouring Nordic coun-
tries. As a consequence, interrupting and ultimately 
stopping transmission chains is not only important to 
minimise virus spread within populations, but also to 
reduce the chances for the virus to accumulate muta-
tions. By 26 September 2021, between 61% and 80% 
of the Nordic population have been fully vaccinated 
against COVID-19 [8]. Vaccinations will help reduce 
transmission chains and protect vulnerable patient 
groups, although the emergence and spread of the 
Delta variant (B.1.617.2) has raised concern about long-
term vaccine effectiveness. In addition, and independ-
ent of the variant, there is also concern about waning 
immunity [30]. Nevertheless, genome sequencing will 
8

continue to play an important role in monitoring poten-
tial vaccine escape mutants and SARS-CoV-2 genetic 
diversity.
Conclusion
Our study highlights the utility of continuous genomic 
surveillance and retrospective studies to compare and 
understand differences in pandemic responses with 
respect to transmission dynamics. In particular, our 
data suggest that transmission chain monitoring may 
prove to be a useful metric in comparing the outcome 
of outbreak mitigation strategies.

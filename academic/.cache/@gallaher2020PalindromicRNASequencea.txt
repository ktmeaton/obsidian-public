Abstract
Much remains unknown concerning the origin of the novel pandemic coronavirus that has raged across the globe since 
emerging in Wuhan of Hubei province, near the center of the People’s Republic of China, in December of 2019. All current 
members of the family Coronaviridae have arisen by a combination of incremental adaptive mutations, against the backdrop 
of many recombinational events throughout the past, rendering each a unique mosaic of RNA sequences from diverse sources. 
The consensus among virologists is that the base sequence of the novel coronavirus, designated SARS-CoV-2, was derived 
from a common ancestor of a bat coronavirus, represented by the strain RaTG13, isolated in Yunnan province in 2013. 
Into that ancestral genetic background, several recombination events have since occurred from other divergent bat-derived 
coronaviruses, resulting in localized discordance between the two. One such event left SARS-CoV-2 with a receptor bind-
ing domain (RBD) capable of binding the human ACE-2 receptor lacking in RaTG13, and a second event uniquely added to 
SARS-CoV-2 a site specific for furin, capable of efficient endoproteolytic cleavage and activation of the spike glycoprotein 
responsible for virus entry and cell fusion. This paper demonstrates by bioinformatic analysis that such recombinational 
events are facilitated by short oligonucleotide “breakpoint sequences”, similar to CAGAC, that direct recombination natu-
rally to certain positions in the genome at the boundaries between blocks of RNA code and potentially RNA structure. This 
“breakpoint sequence hypothesis” provides a natural explanation for the biogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 over time and in the wild.
By mid-December of 2019, hospitals in the area of Wuhan, 
Hubei Province, China, became aware of an outbreak of 
novel pneumonia [1–3] that was not due to either influenza 
virus or a reoccurrence of the severe acute respiratory syn-
drome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) of 2002-2003 [4–6]. The 
early history of what developed into a global pandemic of 
epic proportions was summarized in early January, indi-
cating that community spread was likely to have occurred 
before the center of the outbreak erupted in association with 
the Huanan Seafood Market in central Wuhan [7, 8].
Upon isolation, the causative agent was identified as a 
novel coronavirus of the viral genus Betacoronavirus. The 
viral genome was rapidly sequenced by several groups and 
reported from Shanghai in early January 2020 [2]. The ini-
tial analysis showed that the novel virus was most similar 
(89% sequence identity) to a bat coronavirus, isolate SL-
CoVZC45, but only 78% identical to SARS-CoV of 2003. 
Ultimately, the virus was classified as a member of the sub-
genus Sarbecovirus and officially named severe acute res-
piratory syndrome coronavirus 2, Hu-1, abbreviated SARS-
CoV-2 (GenBank NC_045512.2) [9].
Coronaviruses comprise a very large and diverse family 
of single-stranded RNA viruses with positive polarity [10, 
11], with the longest RNA genomes known, in the case of 
SARS-CoV-2, 29,903 bases long. The genome is divided 
into two overall regions. The 5’ region, roughly 2/3 of the 
genome, is 21,555 bases long. It is translated from the entire 
genome, which serves as an enormous mRNA, into a poly-
protein (Orf1ab) subdivided into two sections by a ribosomal 
frameshift just past midway. From the first section, three

nonstructural and multifunctional proteins, nsp1, nsp2 and 
nsp3, are cleaved at sites recognized by an autocatalytic 
papain-like protease (PL-pro) encoded within nsp3. From 
the second section, eleven additional proteins, nsp4 through 
16, are cleaved by a second autocatalytic protease, 3CL-pro, 
which cuts just past a glutamine (Q), as the uniformly last 
amino acid in each protein.
The second genomic region codes for nine proteins, 
including the four major structural proteins of the virus, 
in the following order: the spike glycoprotein (S), which is 
cleaved into two subunits S1 and S2 [12, 13]; the membrane 
protein E (E); the matrix glycoprotein (M); and the nucle-
ocapsid protein (N). Each of the nine proteins is expressed 
from a nested set of progressively shorter mRNAs that 
begin with a leader RNA derived from the 5’ end of the 
genome, linked to a transcriptional regulatory sequence 
(TRS) (ACG AAC ) repeated at the beginning of each gene 
[14]. All mRNAs derived from the genome have a common 
untranslated 3’OH terminus (nt 29,674-29,903). Coronavi-
ruses are very complex RNA viruses, encoding a total of 23 
different proteins, many of which interact with one another 
in multiprotein aggregates, and some of which have multiple 
structural and functional domains.
Here, I present evidence that the RNA genome of SARS-
CoV-2 is organized into structural and functional blocks of 
RNA information that are demarcated by short RNA break-
point sequences that promote recombination at specific non-
random locations within the viral genome.
Once the SARS-CoV-2 sequence became available, pub-
lic and private communication among virologists, molecular 
biologists, and phylogeneticists exploded, much of it playing 
out on the blog site virological.org or other internet means 
before any formal publications were processed, in an unusu-
ally free and open atmosphere of communication.
In that spirit, on January 24, scientists at the Wuhan Insti-
tute of Virology (WIV) published the sequence of a viral 
isolate obtained from the bat species Rhinolophus affinis in 
2013, designated Bat_RaTG13, which was 96% identical 
to SARS-CoV-2, with an even higher degree of amino acid 
sequence identity [2]. The existence of such a close relative 
to the pandemic virus at a research lab a short distance (12 
km) from the center of the outbreak set off a firestorm of 
commentary that SARS-CoV-2 was derived from labora-
tory manipulation, or at least from accidental release of a 
laboratory isolate. Added to that was the observation that 
SARS-CoV-2 had an apparent insert of four amino acids 
that created a site recognized by the endoproteolytic host 
enzyme furin. Furin-specific activation of the spike glyco-
protein of coronaviruses is common in that peptide region 
but lacking in SARS-CoV of 2003 or other members of the 
genus Betacoronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV-2 [15]. 
Investigators at WIV had previously participated in “gain of 
function” experiments to probe how bat coronaviruses from 
the wild could acquire functions permitting human infec-
tion [16, 17]. The combination of circumstances produced 
a high level of public suspicion that SARS-CoV-2 was the 
product of such a “gain of function” experiment, with a furin 
site deliberately inserted into the Bat_RaTG13 framework.
Several scientists, with great urgency, posted analyses on 
virological.org that showed, either at the RNA or protein 
level, that there was no molecular evidence either supporting 
laboratory manipulation or showing that SARS-CoV-2 could 
have been derived from any known virus in any laboratory 
inventory. My analysis grounded in RNA sequence concern-
ing Bat_RaTG13 was posted shortly before midnight Feb 6 
[18]. A wider analysis, also ruling out an origin from labo-
ratory isolates derived from pangolins, grounded in peptide 
sequence, was posted 10 days later, on February 16, and 
later published [19].
Closer examination of the recombinant regions among 
these viruses, to be reported here, led to the identification 
of a short oligonucleotide sequence at the recombinant 
boundaries within SARS-CoV-2 that may provide a unify-
ing hypothesis concerning some, but not all, of the recom-
binational events known to have occurred in SARS-CoV-2.
It has been widely known for decades that coronavi-
ruses are profligate in engaging in recombination, through 
copy-choice errors involving jumping from one template to 
another [20–22]. I shall focus on key and relatively recent 
recombination events, and not attempt to comprehen-
sively explain all such events in the past. Other breakpoint 
sequences may well be present in the genome, and I have 
made no attempt to comprehensively identify them.
Conjecture on the geographic origin of SARS-CoV-2, i.e., 
the when, where, and by what pathway, is beyond the scope 
of this paper. Indeed, the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown 
as of this writing, and perhaps ultimately unknowable.
Further work by others has generated a general picture of 
the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 genome based on breaks 
in homology in comparison to other known coronaviruses. 
As determined by Li et al. [23], the vast majority of the RNA 
sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is derived from a relatively recent 
common ancestor with Bat_RaTG13. Similarity plots (Sim-
Plot) detected a number of sudden changes in the percent 
identity between SARS-CoV-2, and the base RaTG13-like 
sequence, accompanied by a change in similarity of RaTG13 
to other viruses. Where quantitatively significant, such a 
sudden change can signal a breakpoint for recombination. 
Two such breakpoints were observed, on either side of an 
apparent recombination involving an ancestor of RaTG13, 
an ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 and an ancestor of a betacoro-
navirus isolated in 2019 from a confiscated Malayan pango-
lin, namely Pan_SL-CoV_GD/P1L [24]. This recombina-
tion event left SARS-CoV-2 with a receptor binding domain 
(RBD) capable of binding the human ACE2 receptor and 
RaTG13 with an RBD incapable of doing so.

Breakpoint sequence in copy-choice recombination

In a parallel study, Boni et al. [25] identified a much 
larger number of breakpoints between blocks of RNA, and 
a more complex evolutionary history for both RaTG13 and 
SARS-CoV-2 within a subclade of similar viruses. Indeed 
there are multiple localized regions of sequence discordance 
between the two viruses consistent with a number of recom-
bination events. In their view, against the backdrop of other 
closely related bat and pangolin coronaviruses, the ACE2 
receptor binding region is ancestral to SARS-CoV-2 and was 
lost by RaTG13 in the recombination event, and this is the 
most parsimonious explanation of the evolutionary pattern.
For the purpose of my analysis, the direction of donation 
of the ACE2 receptor binding function is not relevant. The 
important point is that a clear area of recombination involv-
ing these otherwise closely related viruses from the same 
subclade has been identified by both Li et al. [23] and Boni 
et al. [25].
My present analysis extended to the entire genomes of 
five viral isolates, all of which are available to the general 
public. Four were acquired from GenBank: the reference 
sequences for SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512.2), SARS-CoV of 
2003 (NC_004718.3), Bat_RaTG13 (MN996532) and bat 
coronavirus HKU9-1 (EF065513). The fifth, isolated from 
a pangolin, Pan_SL-CoV_GD/P1L, had been deposited in 
the GISAID database as Pangolin.Guangdong-1-2019.EPI_
ISL_410721.2019 [24]. While the genomes themselves are 
RNA, reverse-transcribed DNA is the primary data source, 
so DNA code will be used here. Sequence queries, analy-
sis and alignment were performed using the BLAST utility, 
especially the BLAST2 version, available online from the 
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) https 
://blast .ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast .cgi. Additional alignments 
and graphical renderings were performed using the program 
CLUSTAL X 2.1 [26]. All alignments were checked visu-
ally, and a very few minor adjustments were made that did 
not affect the results but removed specious gaps. For RNA 
structure prediction, the online utility at the University of 
Vienna, Austria, was used (http://rna.tbi.univi e.ac.at/forna /). 
For estimates of a time for the most recent common ances-
tor to two sequences (TMRCA), the determinations of Boni 
et al. [25] were used, i.e. 1946-1980 between SARS-CoV-2 
and its closest relative, RaTG13.
Three months after my original post contrasting the RNA 
sequences of RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 in the vicinity of 
the furin insert, I revisited that analysis in greater detail.
While the S protein is exposed to host selection and the 
immune response and thereby more variable than other parts 
of the genome, these factors do not apply to base changes 
that leave the amino acid sequence unchanged. Neverthe-
less, further analysis of a sequence of 519 amino acids in 
the S glycoprotein that is100% identical in RaTG13 and 
SARS-CoV-2 shows that a 5.1% divergence is consistent. 
Even such a long region of amino acid sequence identity, 
when examined at the RNA level, may conceal an underly-
ing divergence that spans decades. This level of divergence 
renders impossible the assertion that SARS-CoV-2 isolated 
in 2019 was derived from RaTG13 isolated in 2013.
The furin insert is remarkable because it is within a 
519-amino-acid region that is otherwise identical between 
RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2. Coutard et al. [15] had ele-
gantly described the length and sequence polymorphism 
that is common in the immediate vicinity of the furin site, 
but a mechanism of how it occurred at this specific loca-
tion was lacking. It was then that I noticed a tandem dupli-
cation of sequence immediately before the furin insert of 
SARS-CoV-2, namely, CAG ACT CAG ACT (Fig. 1a). Such 
sequence duplication occurs when the viral polymerase 
complex stops and starts, a so-called stutter, and may insert 
either extra bases or produce a tandem duplication. When 
the polymerase complex comes upon a new region of highly 
base-paired stem-loop structure, its processivity is impeded 
as helicase unwinds and “melts” the structure ahead [27]. 
Finding of the tandem duplication raised the possibility that 
the S1/S2 borderline may be such a transition from one block 
of genetic information to the next.
There are only two other locations where a significant 
length polymorphism occurs in comparing the RaTG13 
and SARS-CoV-2 sequences, which are otherwise collinear 
along the entire genome. The first is the insertion of three 
nucleotides and a single amino acid at nt 3332, within the 
Orf1a polyprotein. The other is a similar insertion of a sin-
gle amino acid at the beginning of the M protein. In these 
two instances, the RNA sequence immediately preceding the 
insert is 3327CAGAC and 26527CAGAT, respectively.
I then further examined the recombination site for the 
pangolin-like RBD peptide sequence, which is highly similar 
to that in Pan_SL-CoV_GD/P1L, but also comparing the 
S1 RNA sequence from RaTG13 (Fig. 1b). Its divergence at 
the RNA level is high with respect to both RaTG13 and the 
virus isolated from pangolin, from the latter overwhelmingly 
in synonymous mutations, at 10.4%. This clearly indicates 
that the recombinant sequence was derived from a virus that 
only shares a quite distant ancestor (TMRCA range of 1945 
to 1981) with the virus present in pangolins in 2019. Most 
likely, this divergence occurred long ago in bats. Neverthe-
less, just prior to the upstream recombination breakpoint is 
again found 22839CAGAT, which is conserved in both SARS-
CoV-2 and RaTG13.
There are three iterations of CAGAC/T within a span 
of 91 nucleotides, between nt 22,752 and 22,843, of which 
only the third was noted in Fig. 1b. Three of the three in the 
cluster are conserved between SARS-Cov-2 and RaTG13, 
while two of three are conserved in Pan_SL-CoV_GD/P1L, 
Pan_CoV/GXP2V, SARS-CoV of 2003, and Bat_CoV/
YN2018B, a much wider phylogenetic range of betacoro-
naviruses (not shown).

In further examining the location of 3327CAGAC in 
Orf1a, I noted that there was an unusual degree of diver-
gence between the RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 sequences 
5’ to that breakpoint, an extraordinary 9.1% in RNA and 16 
amino acid differences (18.1%), over a region of just 255 
nucleotides (Fig. 2). At the beginning of this disparity, at 
the transition between a CT-rich region and the AG-rich 
region encoding the acidic-rich region in nsp3, lies the 
sequence 3045CAGAT. This region would appear to define 
another recombination site between an ancestor of RaTG13 
and yet another distant coronavirus sequence. In this case, 
assessment by the BLAST utility indicates that the source 
virus remains unsampled. It is noteworthy, however, that 
the boundaries of the recombination site are CAGAT and 
CAGAC.
Li et al. [23] also demonstrated an unusually high degree 
of similarity (> 99% sequence identity) in the 3’OH untrans-
lated region among not only RaTG13, SARS-CoV-2 and

Pan_SL-CoV_GD/P1L but also SARS-CoV of 2003 (94.5% 
vs. 78% genome-wide). In other coronaviruses, such as Mid-
dle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus, this region 
can be much less conserved. Close examination of the RNA 
sequence at the beginning of the 3’OH region demonstrates 
that SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13 and Pan_SL-CoV_GD/P1L 
share a common identical sequence that is replete with pal-
indromic sequences (Fig. 3a). This may imply that the 3’OH 
region is “contagious” among bat coronaviruses, maintain-
ing a very high degree of similarity by frequent recombina-
tion. Indeed, both CAGAC and CAGAT are found at the 
5’end of the 3’OH sequence.
The origin of the furin site RNA sequence has been a 
complete mystery, even though similar amino acid motifs 
are found in many coronaviruses. A BLAST search for 
the actual insert sequence, CTC CTC GGC GGG , identifies 
a sequence derived from bat coronavirus HKU-9, from a 
region in the S protein downstream of the S1/S2 junction, 
with identity at the last 10 nucleotides. Looking further at 
the HKU9 sequence, CAGAC lies directly prior to the iden-
tity (Fig. 3b).
The insert itself is also replete with short palindromes, 
CTC CTC  and GGCGG. Overall, there are four such palin-
dromes, comprising 21 out of a span of just 27 nucleotides of 
the single-stranded RNA, an unusual feature. (In DNA par-
lance, a palindrome is a sequence that reads the same way on 
each of the two strands. Here, the term is used in its original 
sense, meaning a series of letters that read the same in both 
directions on a single strand.) Common deletions have been 
shown to occur frequently after infection of VeroE6 cells 
by SARS-CoV-2 within only a few passages, repeatedly at 
either CAG ACT CAG ACT AAT  or AAT TCT CCT CGG CGG 
GCA CGT , but neither both at once, nor with a wider overlap 
of the two than the three underlined nucleotides [30]. This

demonstrates that these sequences define repeatedly used 
breakpoints for recombination with biological relevance.
The SARS-CoV-2 and HKU-9 sequences can be aligned 
as 18 identities in a span of 28 nucleotides of HKU-9, with 
minimal gaps. While not perfect, this does support the 
hypothesis that the entire furin insert may have been derived 
by recombination from an as yet unsampled coronavirus, 
mediated by the presence of CAGAC as the lead nucleotide 
in both progenitor viruses, with other palindromic oligonu-
cleotides as contributors. A recent bat coronavirus isolate 
from Yunnan [28] also has an apparent insert at the S1/S2 
border, PAA rather than PRRA, supporting the concept of 
a natural insertion at this site. However, this insert is far too 
dissimilar to the RNA sequence encoding the S protein of 
SARS-CoV-2 to be at all closely related in origin and there-
fore does not contribute an endoproteolytic site for furin.
All of these recombination events, in Orf1a, in the RBD, 
and the furin site itself, have most likely occurred since 
SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 diverged from their most recent 
common ancestor (MRCA). As estimated above, this would 
give a wide range for the time period during which these 
recombination events may have taken place, from the last 
half of the  20th century to the present.
The palindromic CAGAC and its variant CAGAT appear 
to be common, while far from universal, boundary elements 
– “breakpoint sequences” – to all of these recombination 
events identified above. In single-stranded RNA viruses, 
recombination does not commonly take place by breakage 
and rejoining of two complete strands but rather by the poly-
merase slowing or stopping during transcription and jump-
ing to another template strand – “copy choice” – during a 
mixed infection. This can take place in either direction of 
synthesis, even though the vast majority of replications are 
of the positive strand from the negative template. It is per-
haps significant that the breakpoint sequences in the exam-
ples within SARS-CoV-2 are more uniformly at the 5’ end of 
the recombinant or insert. This would imply that the events 
occurred during positive strand synthesis from the negative 
strand template. Since the actual breakpoint sequence would 
be on the template being read 3’ to 5’, this would imply that 
the complement of CAGAC, namely 3’-GTCTG-5’, is what 
is really recognized by the polymerase complex. It is much 
more convenient, however, to define the site on the positive 
genomic strand.
The recombination events delineated here are notably 
defined at either end for the borders of functional regions 
of the genetic information – the acidic-rich region of nsp3, 
and the RBD, the S1/S2 border. They are nonrandomly dis-
tributed, often in clusters, 88 on the positive strand, 46 on 
the minus strand, but sparse between nt 3331 and nt 18855 
(not shown), which Boni et al. [25] identify as a breakpoint-
free region. Therefore, CAGAC and CAGAT may define 
points in the RNA genome that mark the boundaries between 
discreet blocks of RNA code information, corresponding 
to the block pattern of breakpoints observed by Boni et al 
[25]. If so, then recombination events enhancing evolution-
ary adaptation of coronaviruses over vast distances in time 
would involve whole blocks of RNA information and would 
not randomly disrupt the RNA code in the middle of such 
blocks. Domains can be exchanged en bloc, a superior out-
come to creating hybrid blocks of information that may not 
function at the protein level.
Echoes of such an organization of the RNA code into 
blocks, marked by discreet “breakpoint sequences”, can be 
found in the Orf1b region of the coronavirus genome, where 
the polyprotein is broken down into component nsp proteins 
at recognition sites for 3CL-pro protease [14]. For instance, 
the RNA boundaries for 3CL-pro itself are CAGAG and 
CAAAG. For helicase, they are CAGGC and CAAGC. The 
reader will note that these sequences preserve three or four 
out of five of the nucleotide sequences CAGAC and CAGAT 
discussed above, in part because the codons for Q, the uni-
formly terminal amino acid for each nsp, are CAG and CAA. 
The boundaries between nsp proteins, at 11 sites, have been 
ensconced in the peptide sequence for the entire known his-
tory of coronaviruses, likely extending many millions of 
years [29]. Yet a portion of the underlying RNA breakpoint 
sequences CAGAC and CAGAT are still recognizable as that 
in the ancestral organization of the RNA code.

Breakpoint sequence in copy-choice recombination
1 3
The hypothesis being put forward here is that the RNA 
genome of members of the genus Betacoronavirus, includ-
ing SARS-CoV-2, is organized into blocks of information 
bounded by short “breakpoint sequences”. A subset of these 
is identified here in multiple sites as CAGAC and CAGAT. 
It has been suggested previously that the TRS, ACG AAC , 
already active in mRNA splicing, may also serve as a recom-
bination signal [22]. These blocks correspond to functional 
domains in the encoded proteins, and recombination is 
directed to these breakpoints by slowing the processivity 
of RNA polymerase complexes at breakpoints, enhancing 
their jumping the track to an alternate template. A series of 
such events, entirely natural and using a means of genetic 
exchange frequently employed by coronaviruses, accounts 
entirely for the biogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in the wild.
One correlate to this hypothesis recognizes that “sin-
gle-stranded RNA” is something of a misnomer. A 30-kb 
genome cannot exist as an incredibly long rope of RNA. 
Rather, it is routinely organized into highly base-paired 
“double stranded” regions that fold back onto themselves in 
potentially complex stem-loop and pseudoknot structures. 
Virus-encoded helicase is essential precisely because these 
structures would otherwise be an absolute impediment to 
RNA duplication, as well as recombination. Despite RNA 
structure prediction programs, we have a poor understand-
ing of these structures, but a correlate of the breakpoint 
hypothesis would be that “breakpoint sequences” separate 
structural regions of RNA as they do functional regions of 
RNA and protein. It has also been suggested that single-
stranded interstices or loops may be preferential targets of 
RNase-mediated recombination by a breakage-and-repair 
mechanism [see reference 22]. An illustration of a possible 
RNA structure for the RBD insert is shown in Supplemen-
tary Fig. S1. While such proposed structures are hypothetical 
and speculative, this example shows the extraordinary poten-
tial of base-pairing and double-stranded structure that lies 
hidden in single-stranded RNA code. When recombination 
preferentially occurs at breakpoints between such structures, 
the overall structural integrity of the RNA genome would 
therefore be preserved.
The identification of CAGAC and CAGAT as such 
“breakpoint sequences” may be only one of many similar 
signals in RNA code. We already know of the TRS (ACG 
AAC ) for transcription [14], start and stop codons for trans-
lation, and the longer stem-loop structures that regulate the 
molecular biology of many viruses. There may be many 
more.
I would end with a warning. Karst limestone formations 
extend widely across southern China, from Yunnan province 
through Guangxi province and into westernmost Guang-
dong province. Portions of such wilderness are designated 
a UNESCO World Heritage Site (https ://whc.unesc o.org/
en/list/1248). The limestone is riddled with caves carved 
by water flow that are occupied by large colonies of bats. 
Several colonies of both insectivorous microbats and fruit 
macrobats can occupy the same caves. Bats and bat viruses 
of innumerable variety cohabit this ecological environment, 
providing ample and ongoing opportunities for mixed infec-
tion of bats by a variety of bat coronaviruses [10, 11, 31–33]. 
Likewise, bat guano, mined for fertilizer, is a viral soup with 
many contributing sources. The proximal source of SARS-
CoV-2, and particularly of the critical sequences in the RBD 
or furin-sensitive site, remains to be identified.
As these recombination processes are endless, natural and 
ongoing, the possibilities for emergence of pandemic viruses 
from these natural virological parks of Southeast Asia are 
also endless. As the emergence of the 1918 pandemic influ-
enza virus from western Kansas [34, 35], hantavirus from 
the American Southwest [36], Ebola virus from Africa [37], 
and Zika virus from Africa via South America [38] prove, 
emergence can occur from every wilderness area on planet 
Earth. Every human virus represents an emergence from an 
animal source. In the past, they have occurred only occasion-
ally, but in the  21st century, the emergence of a pandemic 
virus has just changed the world as we have known it.

Abstract 
25 
Continuous evolution of Omicron has led to a rapid and simultaneous emergence of numerous 
variants that display growth advantages over BA.5. Despite their divergent evolutionary 
courses, mutations on their receptor-binding domain (RBD) converge on several hotspots. The 
driving force and destination of such convergent evolution and its impact on humoral immunity 
remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that these convergent mutations can cause striking 
30 
evasion of neutralizing antibody (NAb) drugs and convalescent plasma, including those from 
BA.5 breakthrough infection, while maintaining sufficient ACE2 binding capability. BQ.1.1.10, 
BA.4.6.3, XBB, and CH.1.1 are the most antibody-evasive strain tested, even exceeding SARS-
CoV-1 level. To delineate the origin of the convergent evolution, we determined the escape 
mutation profiles and neutralization activity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from 
35 
BA.2 and BA.5 breakthrough-infection convalescents. Importantly, due to humoral immune 
imprinting, BA.2 and especially BA.5 breakthrough infection caused significant reductions in 
the epitope diversity of NAbs and increased proportion of non-neutralizing mAbs, which in 
turn concentrated humoral immune pressure and promoted convergent evolution. Moreover, 
we showed that the convergent RBD mutations could be accurately inferred by integrated deep 
40 
mutational scanning (DMS) profiles, and the evolution trends of BA.2.75/BA.5 subvariants 
could be well-simulated through constructed convergent pseudovirus mutants. Together, our 
results suggest current herd immunity and BA.5 vaccine boosters may not provide good 
protection against infection. Broad-spectrum SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and NAb drugs 
development should be highly prioritized, and the constructed mutants could help to examine 
45 
their effectiveness in advance.

Main 
SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1, BA.2, and BA.5 have demonstrated strong neutralization evasion 
capability, posing severe challenges to the efficacy of existing humoral immunity established 
50 
through vaccination and infection 1-14. Nevertheless, Omicron is continuously evolving, leading 
to various new subvariants, including BA.2.75, BA.4.6, and BF.7 15-21. Importantly, a high 
proportion of these emerging variants display significant growth advantages over BA.5, such 
as BA.2.3.20, BA.2.75.2, BQ.1.1, and especially XBB, a recombinant of BJ.1 and BM.1.1.1 
(Fig. 1) 22. Such rapid and simultaneous emergence of multiple variants with enormous growth 
55 
advantages is unprecedented. Notably, although these derivative subvariants appear to diverge 
along the evolutionary course, the mutations they carry on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) 
converge on the same sites, including R346, K356, K444, V445, G446, N450, L452, N460, 
F486, F490, R493, and S494 (Fig. 1). Most mutations on these residues are known to be 
antibody-evasive, as revealed by deep mutational scanning (DMS) 1,2,23-25. It’s crucial to 
60 
examine the impact of these convergent mutations on antibody-escaping capability, receptor 
binding affinity, and the efficacy of vaccines and antibody therapeutics. It’s also important to 
investigate the driving force behind this suddenly accelerated emergence of RBD mutations, 
what such mutational convergence would lead to, and how we can prepare for such convergent 
RBD evolution.

NAb evasion caused by convergent variants 
First, we tested the antibody evasion capability of these convergent variants. We constructed 
the VSV-based spike-pseudotyped virus of Omicron BA.2, BA.2.75, and BA.4/5 sublineages 
carrying those convergent mutations and examined the neutralizing activities of therapeutic 
neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against them (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 1a) 26-28. In total, 
70 
pseudoviruses of 50 convergent variants were constructed and tested. COV2-2196+COV2-
2130 (Evusheld) 26,29 is vulnerable to F486, R346, and K444-G446 mutations, evaded or highly 
impaired

(R346T+F486I), BA.4.6.1 (R346T+F486V), BA.5.6.2/BQ.1 (K444T+F486V), BU.1

(K444M+F486V), and BQ.1.1 (R346T+K444T+F486V). LY-CoV1404 (Bebtelovimab)

remains potent against BF.16 (K444R) and BA.5.5.1 (N450D) and shows reduced potency 
against BA.5.1.12 (V445A) 27 (Extended Data Fig. 1a). However, LY-CoV1404 was escaped 
by BJ.1, XBB, BR.1, CH.1.1, BA.4.6.3 and BQ.1.1 while exhibiting strongly reduced activity 
against BA.2.38.1, BA.5.6.2, and BQ.1 due to K444N/T mutations and the combination of 
80 
K444M/G446S or V445P/G446S 27. SA55+SA58 is a pair of broad NAbs isolated from 
vaccinated SARS convalescents that target non-competing conserved epitopes 2,28. SA58 is 
weak to G339H and R346T mutations and showed reduced neutralization efficacy against 
BJ.1/XBB and BA.2.75 sublineages. SA55 is the only NAb demonstrating high potency against 
all tested Omicron subvariants. Among the tested variants, XBB and BQ.1.1 exhibited the 
85 
strongest resistance to therapeutic mAbs and cocktails (Fig. 2a). Since the SA55+SA58 cocktail 
is still in preclinical development, the efficacy of available antibody drugs, including the 
BA.2.75/BA.5-effective Evusheld and Bebtelovimab, are extensively affected by the emerging 
subvariants with convergent mutations.  
Sufficient ACE2-binding affinity is essential for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Thus, we 
90 
examined the relative hACE2 binding capability of these variants by evaluating hACE2 
inhibitory efficiency against the pseudoviruses. Higher inhibitory efficiency of soluble hACE2 
against pseudoviruses indicates higher ACE2-binding capability 17. Overall, these convergent 
variants all demonstrate sufficient ACE2-binding efficiency, at least higher than that of D614G, 
including the most antibody-evasive XBB, BQ.1.1, and CH.1.1 (Fig. 2b and Extended Data 
95 
Fig. 1b). Specifically, R493Q reversion increases the inhibitory efficiency of hACE2, which is 
consistent with previous reports 3,17,19. K417T shows a moderate increase in the inhibitory 
efficiency of hACE2. In contrast, F486S, K444M, and K444N have a clear negative impact on 
inhibitory efficiency, while K444T and F486P do not cause significant impairment of ACE2 
binding. These observations are also in line with previous DMS results 30. 
100 
Most importantly, we investigated how these variants escape the neutralization of plasma 
samples from individuals with various immune histories. We recruited cohorts of individuals 
who received 3 doses of CoronaVac 31 with or without breakthrough infection by BA.1, BA.2, 
or BA.5. Convalescent plasma samples were collected on average around 4 weeks after hospital 
discharge (Supplementary Table 1). Plasma from CoronaVac vaccinees was obtained 4 weeks

after the third dose. A significant reduction in the NT50 against most tested BA.2, BA.2.75, or 
BA.5 subvariants has been observed, compared to that against corresponding ancestral BA.2, 
BA.2.75, or BA.5, respectively (Fig. 2c-f and Extended Data Fig. 2a-d).  
Specifically, BA.2.3.20 and BA.2.75.2 are significantly more immune evasive than BA.5 (Fig. 
2c-f), explaining their high growth advantage. Nevertheless, multiple convergent variants 
110 
showed even stronger antibody evasion capability, including BM.1.1.1 (BM.1.1+F490S), CJ.1 
(BM.1.1.1+S486P), CA.1 (BA.2.75.2+L452R+T604I), CA.2 (BA.2.75.2+S494P), CH.1 
(BA.2.75+R346T+K444T+F486S), CH.1.1 (CH.1+L452R) in the BA.2.75 sublineages, and 
BQ.1.1 (BA.5+R346T+K444T+N460K), BQ.1.1.10 (BQ.1.1+Y144del), and BA.4.6.3 
(BA.4.6+K444N+N460K+Y144del) in the BA.4/5 sublineages. Strikingly, the BJ.1/BM.1.1.1 
115 
recombinant strain XBB and XBB.1 (XBB+G252V) are among the most humoral immune 
evasive strains tested, comparable to that of CH.1.1, BQ.1.1.10 and BA.4.6.3. Importantly, 
BA.5 breakthrough infection yields higher plasma NT50 against BA.5 sublineages, including 
BQ.1.1; however, plasma from BA.5 breakthrough infection neutralize poorly against XBB, 
CH.1.1, BQ.1.1.10 and BA.4.6.3, suggesting that the NTD mutations they carry are extremely 
120 
effective at evading NAbs elicited by BA.5 breakthrough infection (Fig. 2f). Notably, the 
strongest immune-evasive convergent variants have displayed even lower NT50 than SARS-
CoV-1, suggesting immense antigenic drift and potential serotype conversion.  
Immune imprinting induces convergent evolution 
It is crucial to investigate the origin of such accelerated RBD convergent evolution. Therefore, 
125 
we characterized the antibody repertoires induced by Omicron BA.2 and BA.5 breakthrough 
infection, which is the dominant immune background of current global herd immunity. 
Following the strategy described in our previous report using pooled PBMC from BA.1 
breakthrough infection 2, we enriched antigen-specific memory B cells by fluorescence-
activated cell sorting (FACS) for individuals who had recovered from BA.2 and BA.5 
130 
breakthrough infection (Supplementary Table 1). RBD-binding CD27+/IgM-/IgD- cells were 
subjected to single-cell V(D)J sequencing (scVDJ-seq) to determine the BCR sequences 
(Extended Data Fig. 3a-b).

Similar to that reported in BA.1 breakthrough infection, immune imprinting, or so-called 
“original antigenic sin”, is also observed in BA.2 and BA.5 breakthrough infection 2,32-35. Post-
135 
vaccination infection with BA.2 and BA.5 mainly recalls cross-reactive memory B cells 
elicited by wildtype-based vaccine, but rarely produces BA.2/BA.5 specific B cells, similar to 
BA.1 breakthrough infection (Fig. 3a-b). This is in marked contrast to Omicron infection 
without previous vaccination (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 3c). The RBD-targeting antibody 
sequences determined by scVDJ-seq are then expressed in vitro as human IgG1 monoclonal 
140 
antibodies (mAbs). As expected, only a small proportion of the expressed mAbs specifically 
bind to BA.2/BA.5 RBD and are not cross-reactive to WT RBD, determined by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), concordant with the FACS results (Fig. 3d). Importantly, cross-
reactive mAbs exhibit significantly higher somatic hypermutation (SHM), indicating that these 
antibodies are more affinity-matured and are indeed most likely recalled from previously 
145 
vaccination-induced memory (Fig. 3d).  
Next, we determined the escape mutation profiles of these antibodies by high-throughput DMS 
and measured their neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 D614G, BA.2, BA.5, BA.2.75, 
BQ.1.1 and XBB (Fig. 3e, 3g and Extended Data Fig. 4a-b). Previously, we reported the DMS 
profiles and the epitope distribution of antibodies isolated from WT vaccinated/infected 
150 
individuals, SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated SARS convalescents, and BA.1 convalescents, which 
could be classified into 12 epitope groups 2. Among them, mAbs in groups A, B, C, D1, D2, 
F2, and F3 compete with ACE2 and exhibit neutralizing activity (Fig. 3h, Extended Data Fig. 
5a-d and 6a-d); while mAbs in groups E1, E2.1, E2.2, E3, and F1 do not compete with ACE2 
(Fig. 3h, Extended Data Fig. 7a-c). Antibodies in groups E2.2, E3, and F1 exhibit low or no 
155 
neutralizing capability (Extended Data Fig. 4b, 7d). To integrate the previous dataset with DMS 
profiles of the new mAbs isolated from BA.2 and BA.5 convalescents, we co-embedded all 
antibodies using multidimensional scaling (MDS) based on their DMS profiles, followed by t-
distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) for visualization, and used KNN-based 
classification to determine the epitope groups of new mAbs (Fig. 3e). This results in a dataset 
160 
containing the DMS profiles of 3051 SARS-CoV-2 WT RBD-targeting mAbs in total 
(Supplementary Table 2). The epitope distribution of mAbs from BA.2 breakthrough infection

is generally similar to those elicited by BA.1, except for the increased proportion of mAbs in 
group C (Fig. 3f). However, BA.5-elicited mAbs showed a more distinct distribution compared 
to BA.1, with a significantly increased proportion of mAbs in group D2 and E2.2, and 
165 
decreased ratio of antibodies in groups B and E2.1. The main reason is that the F486 and L452 
mutations carried by BA.5 make these cross-reactive memory B cells unable to be activated 
and recalled (Fig. 3f, Extended Data Fig. 5b, 6a and 7a). Remarkably, antibody repertoires 
induced by all Omicron breakthrough infections are distinct from those stimulated by WT. 
Compared to WT infection or vaccination, BA.1, BA.2, and BA.5 breakthrough infection 
170 
mainly elicit mAbs of group E2.2, E3, and F1, which do not compete with ACE2 and 
demonstrate weak neutralizing activity, while WT-elicited antibodies enrich mAbs of groups 
A, B, and C which compete with ACE2 and exhibit strong neutralization potency (Fig. 3f-h). 
Strikingly, the combined proportion of E2.2, E3, and F1 antibodies rose from 29% in WT 
convalescents/vaccinees, 53% in BA.1 convalescents, 51% in BA.2 convalescents, to 63% in 
175 
BA.5 convalescents (Fig. 3f). Overall, the proportion and diversity of neutralizing antibody 
epitopes are reduced in Omicron breakthrough infection, especially in BA.5 breakthrough 
infection.  
To better delineate the impact of immune imprinting and consequent reduction of NAb epitope 
diversity on the RBD evolutionary pressure, we aggregated the DMS profiles of large 
180 
collections of mAbs to estimate the impact of mutations on the efficacy of humoral immunity, 
as inspired by previous works (Supplementary Table 2) 36. It is essential to incorporate the 
effects of ACE2 binding, RBD expression, neutralizing activity of mAbs, and codon usage 
constraint with the escape profiles to estimate the SARS-CoV-2 evolution trend on the RBD. 
In brief, each mutation on the RBD would have an impact on each mAb in the set, which is 
185 
quantified by the escape scores determined by DMS and weighted by its IC50 against the 
evolving strain. For each residue, only those amino acids that are accessible by one nucleotide 
mutation are included. Impacts on ACE2-binding capability (as measured by pseudovirus 
inhibitory efficiency) and RBD expression of each mutation are also considered in the analyses, 
using data determined by DMS in previous reports 30,37,38. Finally, the estimated relative 
190 
preference of each mutation is calculated using the sum of weighted escape scores of all mAbs 
.

in the specific set.  
The reduced NAb epitope diversity caused by imprinted humoral response could be strikingly 
shown by the estimated mutation preference spectrum (Fig. 4a). Diversified escaping-score 
peaks, which also represent immune pressure, could be observed when using BA.2-elicited 
195 
antibodies, while only two major peaks could be identified, R346T/S and K444E/Q/N/T/M, 
when using BA.5-elicited antibodies (Fig. 4a). Interestingly, these two hotspots are the most 
frequently mutated sites in continuously evolving BA.4/5 subvariants, and convergently 
occurred in multiple lineages (Fig. 1). Similar analyses for WT and BA.1 also demonstrated 
diversified peaks; thus, the concentrated immune pressure strikingly reflects the reduced 
200 
diversity of NAbs elicited by BA.5 breakthrough infection due to immune imprinting, and these 
concentrated preferred mutations highly overlapped with convergent hotspots observed in the 
real world (Extended Data Fig. 8a-b). Together, our results indicate that due to immune 
imprinting, BA.5 breakthrough infection caused significant reductions of NAb epitope 
diversity and increased proportion of non-neutralizing mAbs, which in turn concentrated 
205 
immune pressure and promoted the convergent RBD evolution.  
Accurate inference of RBD evolution hotspots 
Moreover, we wonder if the real-world evolutionary trends of SARS-CoV-2 RBD could be 
rationalized and even predicted by aggregating this large DMS dataset containing mAbs from 
various immune histories. Using the mAbs elicited from WT vaccinees or convalescents 
210 
weighted by IC50 against the D614G strain, we identified mutation hotspots including 
K417N/T, K444-G446, N450, L452R, and especially E484K (Extended Data Fig. 8a). Most of 
these residues were mutated in previous VOCs, such as K417N/E484K in Beta, K417T/E484K 
in Gamma, L452R in Delta, and G446S/E484A in Omicron BA.1, confirming our estimation 
and inference. Evidence of the emergence of BA.2.75 and BA.5 could also be found using WT, 
215 
BA.1, and BA.2-elicited mAbs with IC50 against BA.2, where peaks on 444-446, 452, 460, 
and 486 could be identified (Extended Data Fig. 8c). To better investigate the evolution trends 
of BA.2.75 and BA.5, the two major lineages circulating currently, we then included antibodies 
elicited by various immune background, including WT/BA.1/BA.2/BA.5 convalescents, which

we believe is the best way to represent the current heterogeneous global humoral immunity 
220 
(Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 8d). For BA.2.75, the most significant sites are R346T/S, 
K356T, N417Y/H/I/T, K444E/Q/N/T/M, V445D/G/A, N450T/D/K/S, L452R, I468N, A484P, 
F486S/V, and F490S/Y. We noticed that these identified residues, even specific mutations, 
highly overlapped with recent mutation hotspots of BA.2.75 (Fig. 1). Two exceptions are A484 
and I468N. E484 is a featured residue of Group C antibodies and could be covered by L452 
225 
and F490 (Extended Data Fig. 5c). I468N mutation is also highly associated with K356 
mutations, and its function could be covered by K356T (Extended Data Fig. 7a-b). Due to 
stronger antibody evasion, the preference spectrum of BA.5 is much more concentrated 
compared to BA.2.75, but the remaining sites are highly overlapped and complementary with 
BA.2.75. The most striking residues are R346, K444-G446, and N450, followed by K356, 
230 
N417, L455, N460, and A484. As expected, L452R/F486V does not stand out in BA.5 
preference spectrum, while N460K harbored by BA.2.75 appears. These sites and mutations 
are also popular in emerging BA.4/5 subvariants, proving that our RBD evolution inference 
system works accurately. 
NAb evasion mechanism of convergent mutations 
235 
It is important to examine where this convergent evolution would lead. Based on the observed 
and predicted convergent hotpots on RBD of BA.2.75 and BA.5, we wonder if we could 
construct the convergent variants in advance and investigate to what extent they will evade the 
humoral immune response. To do this, we must first evaluate the antibody evasion mechanism 
and impact on hACE2-binding capability of the convergent mutations and their combinations. 
240 
Thus, we selected a panel of 178 NAbs from 8 epitope groups that could potently neutralize 
BA.2 and determined their neutralizing activity against constructed mutants carrying single or 
multiple convergent mutations (Fig. 4c, Extended Data Fig. 9a). Most of these sites were 
selected since we have observed at least 5 independent emergences in distinct lineages of BA.2 
and BA.5 that exhibited a growth advantage. NAbs from F1-F3 epitope groups were not 
245 
included since they are either completely escaped by BA.2 or too rare in Omicron-infected 
convalescents (Fig. 3f). As expected, R493Q and N417T are not major contributors to antibody 
evasion, but R493Q significantly benefits ACE2 binding. V445A and K444N caused slightly,

and F486S/V caused significantly reduced ACE2-binding capability, consistent with the 
measurement of emerging subvariants (Fig. 2a, 4c and Extended Data Fig. 1a). The 
250 
neutralization of NAbs in each group is generally in line with DMS profiles. Most group A 
NAbs are sensitive to N460K and L455S, and BA.5+N460K escapes the majority of NAbs in 
group A due to the combination of F486V and N460K (Extended Data Fig. 5a). All NAbs in 
group B are escaped by F486S/V, and Group C NAbs are heavily escaped by F490S and are 
strongly affected by L452R and F486S/V (Extended Data Fig. 5b-c). A part of group C NAbs

is also slightly affected by K444N/T, S494P and N450D. G446S affects a part of the D1/D2 
NAbs, as previously reported 19. D1/D2 NAbs are more susceptible to K444N/T, V445A and 
N450D, and some D1 NAbs could also be escaped by L452R, F490S, and S494P (Extended 
Data Fig. 6a-b). E1 is mainly affected by R346T, D339H and K356T (Extended Data Fig. 6c). 
E2.1 and E2.2 exhibit similar properties, evaded by K356T, R346T and L452R (Extended Data 
260 
Fig. 7a-b). E3 antibodies seem not significantly affected by any of the constructed mutants, as 
expected (Extended Data Fig. 7c), but they generally exhibit very low neutralization (Extended 
Data Fig. 7d). BA.5+R346T escapes most antibodies in D1, E1, and E2.1/E2.2, and an 
additional K444N further escapes most mAbs in D2, demonstrating the feasibility and 
effectiveness of combining convergent mutations to achieve further evasion. Importantly, 
265 
adding six mutations to BA.5 could achieve the evasion of the vast majority of RBD NAbs, 
while exhibiting high hACE2-binding capability, despite the reduction caused by K444N/T and 
F486V. BQ.1.1, XBB and CH.1.1 could also escape the majority of RBD-targeting NAbs. 
Together, these findings indicate the feasibility of generating a heavy-antibody-escaping 
mutant harboring accumulated convergent escape mutations while maintaining sufficient 
270 
hACE2-binding capability (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 9a).  
Although the proportion of Omicron-specific mAbs is low due to immune imprinting, it is still 
necessary to evaluate their neutralization potency and breadth, especially against the 
convergent mutants. We tested the neutralizing activity of a panel of Omicron-specific RBD-
targeting mAbs against D614G, BA.1, BA.2, BA.5, BA.2.75, BA.2.75.2, BR.1, BR.2, CA.1, 
275 
BQ.1.1 and XBB. These mAbs were isolated from convalescent plasma one month after 
Omicron breakthrough infection (Fig. 4d). They could bind RBD of the corresponding exposed

Omicron variant but do not cross-bind WT RBD, as confirmed by ELISA. We found these 
mAbs could effectively neutralize against the exposed strain, as expected, but exhibited poor 
neutralizing breadth, which means their potency would be largely impaired by other Omicron 
280 
subvariants, consistent with our previous discovery 2. Notably, BQ.1.1 and XBB could escape 
most of these Omicron-specific NAbs. Thus, these Omicron-specific antibodies would not 
effectively expand the breadth of the neutralizing antibody repertoire of Omicron breakthrough 
infection when facing convergent variants. Further affinity maturation may improve the breadth, 
but additional experiment is needed. 
285 
We then evaluated the potency of NTD-targeting NAbs against BA.2, BA.4/5, BA.2.75 and 
their sublineages and constructed mutants with selected NTD mutations using a panel of 14 
NTD-targeting NAbs, as it is reported that NTD-targeting antibodies are abundant in plasma 
from BA.2 breakthrough infection and contribute to cross-reactivity 39. Most selected 
mutations are from recently designated Omicron subvariants, except for R237T, which was 
290 
near V83A, designed to escape mAbs targeting an epitope reported recently 19. None of the 
NTD-targeting NAbs exhibit strong neutralizing potency, and the IC50 values are all over 0.2 
μg/mL 40,41 (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 9b). We found the tested BA.2-effective NTD-
targeting NAbs could be separated into two clusters, named group α and δ in our previous 
report, respectively 19 (Extended Data Fig. 9c). NAbs in group α target the well-known 
295 
antigenic supersite on NTD 42, which is sensitive to K147E and W152R harbored by BA.2.75*, 
and Y144del harbored by BJ.1/XBB; while the other group δ is affected by V83A (XBB) and 
R237T. The other three NTD mutations harbored by BA.2.75, F157L, I210V and G257S did 
not significantly affect the tested mAbs, consistent with previous sera neutralization data 17. 
Two of the NTD mutations harbored by BJ.1 or XBB, Y144del and V83A, each escapes a 
300 
cluster of them and together would enable XBB to exhibit extremely strong capability of 
escaping NTD-targeting NAbs. Notably, XBB.1 escaped all NTD-targeting NAbs tested here.  
Simulation of convergent variant evolution 
Based on the above results, we designed multiple VSV-based pseudoviruses that gradually gain 
convergent mutations that could induce RBD/NTD-targeting NAb resistance (Fig. 5a). The

constructed final mutant contains 11 additional mutations on the NTD and RBD compared to 
BA.5, or 9 mutations compared to BA.2.75. The neutralizing activities of Omicron-effective 
NAb drugs were first evaluated. As expected, the majority of existing effective NAb drugs, 
except SA55, are escaped by these mutants (Fig. 5b). Similarly, we also determined the ACE2-
binding capability of these mutants by neutralization assays using hACE2 (Fig. 5c). Although 
310 
some of the designed pseudoviruses, especially those with K444N and F486V, exhibit reduced 
activity to hACE2 compared to original BA.2.75 or BA.5 variants, their binding affinities are 
still higher than that of D614G (Fig. 2b). Importantly, our designed pseudoviruses could largely 
evade the plasma of vaccinees and convalescents after BA.1 breakthrough infection, BA.2 
breakthrough infection, and even BA.5 breakthrough infection (Fig. 5d-g). Among the 
315 
derivative mutants of BA.2.75, L452R, K444M, R346T, and F486V contribute mainly to the 
significant reduction in neutralization (Fig. 5d-g). Adding more NTD mutations does not 
contribute to stronger evasion in BA.2.75-based mutants, but we observed a significant 
reduction in NT50 of BA.2/BA.5 convalescents against BA.5-based mutants with 
K147E+W152R, suggesting BA.2/BA.5 convalescent plasma contains a large proportion of 
320 
NTD-targeting antibodies 39. As the NTD of BA.1 differs from that of BA.2 and BA.5, we did 
not observe significant effects of NTD mutations on the efficacy of BA.1 convalescent plasma. 
Plasma neutralization titers of most vaccinees and convalescents decreased to the lower 
detection limit against BA.2.75 with 5 extra RBD mutations L452R, K444M, R346T, F486V, 
and K356T. The same applies to vaccinees or BA.1 convalescents against BA.5 with 4 extra 
325 
RBD mutations K444N, R346T, N460K, and K356T. The plasma from BA.2/BA.5 
convalescents can tolerate more mutations based on BA.5, and extra NTD mutations such as 
K147E and W152R are needed to completely eliminate their neutralization. Together, we 
demonstrate that as few as five additional mutations on BA.5 or BA.2.75 could completely 
evade most plasma samples, including those from BA.5 breakthrough infection, while 
330 
maintaining high hACE2-binding capability. Similar efforts have been made in a recent report 
despite different construction strategies 43. The constructed evasive mutants, such as BA.2.75-
S5/6/7/8 and BA.5-S7/8, could serve to examine the effectiveness of broad-spectrum vaccines 
and NAbs in advance.

Discussion 
335 
In this work, we showed that convergent RBD evolution can cause severe immune evasion and 
could be rationalized by integrating DMS profiles. Given the existence of immune imprinting, 
the humoral immune repertoire is not effectively diversified by infection with new Omicron 
variants, while the immune pressure on the RBD becomes increasingly concentrated and 
promotes convergent evolution, posing a great challenge to current vaccines and antibody drugs.  
340 
Although this study only examines inactivated vaccines, immune imprinting is also observed 
in those receiving mRNA vaccines 44,45. In fact, mRNA-vaccinated individuals displayed an 
even higher proportion of cross-reactive memory B cells, probably because the overall humoral 
immune response induced by mRNA vaccines is stronger than that induced by inactivated 
vaccines 45. Also, recent studies on mRNA vaccinees who receive a BA.5 booster or BA.5 
345 
breakthrough infection displayed similar neutralization reduction trend against BA.2.75.2, 
BQ.1 and BQ.1.1, suggesting high consistency of neutralization data among vaccine types 46,47. 
As the antibodies undergo affinity maturation, their SHM rate would increase 45. This may lead 
to a higher proportion of variant-specific antibodies, enhanced binding affinity, and increased 
neutralization breadth, which could potentially resist the convergent mutations carried by 
350 
variants like XBB and BQ.1.1 48. However, the effect of affinity maturation may be 
counteracted by waning immunity 45,49. The affinity-matured memory B cells would require a 
second booster or reinfection to be effectively deployed. 
We also observed that plasma from convalescents with BA.5 breakthrough infection exhibited 
higher neutralization against BA.5-derived variants like BQ.1 and BQ.1.1, suggesting that 
355 
BA.5-based boosters are beneficial to protection against convergent variants of BA.5 
sublineages. However, this may be mainly driven by the enrichment of NTD-targeting 
antibodies after BA.5 breakthrough infection, which was also reported in BA.2 convalescents 
39. Significant mutations on NTD, such as Y144del in XBB and BQ.1.18, and mutations of 
many BA.2.75 sublineages, would cause severe reduction in BA.5 breakthrough infection 
360 
plasma neutralization titers. Therefore, the effectiveness of BA.5-based boosters against the 
convergent mutants carrying critical NTD mutations should be closely monitored.

Notably, the antibody evasion capability of many variants, such as BQ.1.1, CA.1, BQ.1.18, 
XBB, and CH.1.1, have already reached or even exceeded SARS-CoV-1, indicating extensive 
antigenic drift (Fig. 5d-g). Indeed, by constructing an antigenic map of the tested SARS-CoV-
365 
2/SARS-CoV-1 variants using the plasma NT50 data, we found that the antigenicity distances 
of SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain to CA.1, CH.1.1, XBB and BQ.1.1 are already comparable to 
that of SARS-CoV-1 (Extended Data Fig. 10a-b). Given that there are ~50 different amino 
acids between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD, but only 21 mutations on BQ.1.1 RBD 
compared to the ancestral strain, these results indicate that the global pandemic indeed has 
370 
greatly promoted the efficiency of the virus to evolve immune escape mutations. 
Finally, our prediction demonstrated a remarkable consistency with real-world observations. 
Some variants close to the predicted and constructed variants have already emerged while we 
performed the experiments, validating our prediction model. For example, BQ.1.1 is highly 
similar to BA.5-S3, and CH.1.1 to BA.2.75-S4/S6 (Fig. 4c). The whole pipeline for 
375 
constructing pseudoviruses carrying predicted mutations could be safely conducted in biosafety 
level 2 (BSL-2) laboratories, and does not involve any infectious pandemic virus. If we had 
this prediction model at the beginning of the pandemic, the development of NAb drugs and 
vaccines might not be so frustrated against the continuously emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. 
Broad-spectrum SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and NAb drugs development should be of high priority, 
380 
and the constructed convergent mutants could serve to examine their effectiveness in advance.

with a MoFlo Astrios EQ Cell Sorter. FACS data were analyzed using FlowJo v10.8 (BD 
Biosciences).  
Sorted B cells were resuspended in the appropriate volume and then processed with Chromium 
600 
Next GEM Single Cell V(D)J Reagent Kits v1.1 following the manufacturer’s user guide (10x 
Genomics, CG000208). Gel beads-in-emulsion (GEMs) were obtained with a 10X Chromium 
controller. GEMs were subjected to reverse transcription and purification. Reverse 
transcription products were subject to preamplification and purification with SPRIselect 
Reagent Kit (Beckman Coulter, B23318). BCR sequences (paired V(D)J) were enriched with 
605 
10X BCR primers. After library preparation, libraries were sequenced with the Illumina 
sequencing platform. 
10X Genomics V(D)J sequencing data were assembled as BCR contigs and aligned using Cell 
Ranger (v6.1.1) pipeline according to the GRCh38 BCR reference. Only the productive contigs 
and the B cells with one heavy chain and one light chain were kept for quality control. The 
610 
germline V(D)J gene identification and annotation were performed by IgBlast (v1.17.1)51. 
Somatic hypermutation sites in the antibody variable domain were detected using Change-O 
toolkit (v1.2.0)52. 
Antibody heavy and light chain genes were optimized for human cell expression and 
synthesized by GenScript. VH and VL were inserted separately into plasmids (pCMV3-CH, 
615 
pCMV3-CL or pCMV3-CK) through infusion (Vazyme, C112). Plasmids encoding the heavy 
chain and light chain of antibodies were co-transfected by polyethylenimine-transfection to 
Expi293F™ cell (ThermoFisher, A14527). Cells were cultured at 36.5℃, 5% CO2, 175 rpm 
for 6-10 days. Supernatants containing mAbs were collected, and the supernatants were further 
purified with protein A magnetic beads (Genscript, L00695).

was appended to each RBD variant in mutant libraries by PCR, and the correspondence 
625 
between the N26 barcode and mutations in RBD variants was acquired by PacBio sequencing. 
RBD mutant libraries were first transformed in the EBY100 strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
and then enriched for properly folded ACE2 binders, which were used for subsequent mutation 
escape profiling. The above ACE2 binders were grown in SG-CAA media (2% w/v d-galactose, 
0.1% w/v dextrose (d-glucose), 0.67% w/v yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% w/v casamino acids (−ade, 
630 
−ura, −trp), 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.0) at room temperature for 16-18h with agitation. 
Then these yeast cells were washed twice and proceeded to three rounds of magnetic beads-
based selection. Obtained yeast cells after sequential sorting were recovered overnight in SD-
CAA media (2% w/v dextrose (d-glucose), 0.67% w/v yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% w/v casamino 
acids (−ade, −ura, −trp), 70 mM citrate buffer, pH 4.5). Pre- and post-sort yeast populations 
635 
were submitted to plasmid extraction by 96 Well Plate Yeast Plasmid Preps Kit (Coolaber, 
PE053). N26 barcode sequences were amplified with the extracted plasmid templates, and PCR 
products were purified and submitted to Illumina Nextseq 550 sequencing.  
Antibody clustering and embedding based on DMS profiles 
Data analysis of DMS was performed as described in previous reports 1,2. In brief, the detected 
640 
barcode sequences of both the antibody-screened and reference library were aligned to the 
barcode-variant lookup table generated using dms_variants (v0.8.9). The escape scores of each 
variant X in the library were defined as F×(nX,ab / Nab) / (nX,ref / Nref), where F is a scale factor 
to normalize the scores to the 0-1 range, while n and N are the number of detected barcodes for 
variant X and total barcodes in post-selected (ab) or reference (ref) samples, respectively. The 
645 
escape scores of each mutation were calculated by fitting an epistasis model as described 
previously 37,53.  
Epitope groups of new antibodies not included in our previous report are determined by k-
nearest neighbors (KNN)-based classification. In brief, site escape scores of each antibody are 
first normalized and considered as a distribution across RBD residues, and only residues whose 
650 
standard derivation is among the highest 50% of all residues are retained for further analysis. 
Then the dissimilarity or distance of two antibodies is defined by the Jessen-Shannon 
.

divergence of the normalized escape scores. Pair-wise dissimilarities of all antibodies in the 
dataset are calculated using the scipy package (scipy.spatial.distance.jensenshannon, v1.7.0). 
For each antibody, 15 nearest neighbors whose epitope groups have been determined by 
655 
unsupervised clustering in our previous paper are identified and simply voted to determine the 
group of the selected antibody. To project the dataset onto a 2D space for visualization, we 
performed MDS to represent each antibody in a 32-dimensional space, and then t-SNE to get 
the 2D representation, using sklearn.manifold.MDS and sklearn.manifold.TSNE (v0.24.2). 
Calculation of the estimated preference of RBD mutations 
660 
Four different weights are included in the calculation, including the weight for ACE2-binding 
affinity, RBD expression, codon constraint, and neutralizing activity. Impact on ACE2-binding 
affinity and RBD expression of each mutation based on WT, BA.1 and BA.2 are obtained from 
public DMS results. And for BA.5 (BA.2+L452R+F486V+R493Q) and BA.2.75 
(BA.2+D339H+G446S+N460K+R493Q), BA.2 results are used except for these mutated 
665 
residues, whose scores for each mutant are subtracted by the score for the mutation in BA.5 or 
BA.2.75. As the reported values are log fold changes, the weight is simply defined by the 
exponential of reported values, i.e., exp [������������bind]  or exp[������������expr] , respectively. For codon 
constraint, the weight is 1.0 for mutants that could be accessed by one nucleotide mutation, and 
0.0 for others. We used the following RBD nucleotide sequences for determination of 
670 
accessible mutants, WT/D614G (Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome), BA.1 (EPI_ISL_10000028), 
BA.2 (EPI_ISL_10000005), BA.4/5 (EPI_ISL_11207535), BA.2.75 (EPI_ISL_13302209). 
For neutralizing activity, the weight is -log10(IC50). The IC50 values (μg/mL), which are 
smaller than 0.0005 or larger than 1.0 are considered as 0.0005 or 1.0, respectively. The raw 
escape scores for each antibody are first normalized by the max score among all mutants, and 
675 
the final weighted score for each antibody and each mutation is the production of the 
normalized scores and four corresponding weights. The final mutation-specific weighted score 
is the summation of scores of all antibodies in the designated antibody set, and then normalized 
again to make it a value between 0 and 1. Logo plots for visualization of escape maps were 
generated by the Python package logomaker (v0.8).

Pseudovirus neutralization assay 
The Spike gene (GenBank: MN908947) was mammalian condon-optimized and inserted into 
the pcDNA3.1 vector. Site-directed mutagenesis PCR was performed as described previously54. 
The sequence of mutants is shown in Supplementary Table 3. Pseudotyped viruses were 
generated by transfection 293T cells (ATCC, CRL-3216) with pcDNA3.1-Spike with 
685 
Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen). The cells were subsequently infected with G*ΔG-VSV 
(Kerafast) that packages expression cassettes for firefly luciferase instead of VSV-G in the VSV 
genome. The cell supernatants were discarded after 6-8h harvest and replaced with complete 
culture media. The cell was cultured for one day, and then the cell supernatant containing 
pseudotyped virus was harvested, filtered (0.45-μm pore size, Millipore), aliquoted, and stored 
690 
at -80 °C. Viruses of multiple variants were diluted to the same number of copies before use. 
mAbs or plasma was serially diluted and incubated with the pseudotyped virus in 96-well plates 
for 1 h at 37°C. Trypsin-treated Huh-7 cells (Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources, 
0403) were added to the plate. The cells were cultured for 20-28 h in 5% CO2, 37°C incubators. 
The supernatants were removed and left 100 μL in each well, and 100 μL luciferase substrate 
695 
(Perkinelmer, 6066769) was added and incubated in the dark for 2 min. The cell lysate was 
removed, and the chemiluminescence signals were collected by PerkinElmer Ensight. Each 
experiment was repeated at least twice. 
Inhibitory efficiencies of hACE2 against the pseudoviruses were determined with the same 
procedure, using hACE2-Fc dimer (Sino Biological, 10108-H02H), and each experiment was 
700 
conducted in five biological replicates. 
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM, high glucose; HyClone) with 100 U/mL of 
penicillin-streptomycin solution (Gibco), 20 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N-2-ethane 
sulfonic acid (HEPES, Gibco) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco) were used in cell 
culture. Trypsin-EDTA (0.25%, Gibco) was used to detach cells before seeding to the plate.

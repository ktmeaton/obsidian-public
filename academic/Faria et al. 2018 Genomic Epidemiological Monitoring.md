## Summary

- I came across this literature from the [[Phylogeography]] [[BEAST]] tutorial on [Continuous Diffusion](https://beast.community/workshop_continuous_diffusion_yfv).
>We caution that hypotheses of human-to-human transmission linkage should not be tested directly using [[Phylogenetic|phylogenetic]] data alone, owing to the large [[Under-represented\|undersampling]] of [nonhuman primates] infections.
- The authors discuss the analytical and interpretive risks associated with [[Under-represented|undersampling]], particular when [[non-human]] samples are excluded. Given the multi-host [[ecology]] of [[Plague]], there will be strong parallels in these findings. They caution that [[Phylogenetic|phylogenetic]] data alone is insufficient to test hypotheses such as transmission linkage in this situation.

## Figures

> Reconstructed [[Spatiotemporal]] [[Diffusion]] of the [[Yellow Fever Virus|YFV]] [[Outbreak|outbreak]]. [[Phylogeny]] [[Branch|branch]]es are arranged in space according the locations of phylogeny [[Nodes|nodes]] (circles). Locations of external nodes are known, whereas those of internal nodes are inferred.

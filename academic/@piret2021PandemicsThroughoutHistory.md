- Major pandemics and epidemics such as plague, cholera, ï¬‚u, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have already afï¬‚icted humanity.
- Avian Inï¬‚uenza and the Risks for a New Pandemic The constant adaptation and exchange of genes between inï¬‚uenza viruses in diï¬€erent species, including at the animalhuman interface, is still a critical challenge for the emergence of pandemic viruses nowadays.
- Dis.
- These vaccines should be used in areas with endemic cholera, cholera outbreaks and humanitarian crisis with high-risk of cholera in combination with other cholera prevention and control measures (World Health Organization [WHO], 2019).
- The 1968â€“1970 pandemic virus emerged when 2 gene segments encoding for HA and PB1 polymerase moved from an avian virus in the A/H2N2 virus through genetic reassortment whereas the NA remained unchanged (Kawaoka et al., 1989).

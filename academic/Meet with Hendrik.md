## [[2021-06-24]]

[Meeting Link](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/81199389961?pwd=L2lPSGNSaUtwaGxCa3BLaldVZ0dtZz09)

Phylogeography Questions:
	- What kind of migration events are high confidence?
	- Intercontinental vs. subtle movements
	Cases: agreement, uncertainty, conflict (history vs. genetics)
	- multiple introductions,
	
Geographic structure cryptic 

Frame the past in the context

- Do the genetics agree with any historical narratives?

- what sigma for radiocarbon

3 part:
	- Which parts are robust?
	- Why agree?
	COVID comparison

- Meeting with Rav, Kat
	
Plot timeline?
- what we can and cannot say about the past
- more epidemiological states

	
	
5 Clades:
	- [[1.PRE]], [[0.ANT4]], [[1.ORI]]
	- [[0.PRE]], [[2.MED]]
	
- Dismantling narratives about movement
- Why do we care?
- Nature Ecology and Evolution, Nature Microbioly
- Issue of identical strains with drastic geographic distance and time
- Elusive search for origins
- What it says, why it's probleatic, why it cares?
- Every pandemic experience is anchored to history of plague
- Email John again

Last Day to Defend: August 19, 2020
File for Defense | Traditional: 2 + 6 weeks before defense (June 19, 2020)
File for Defense | Accelerated: 2 + 6 weeks before defense (June 19, 2020)

- Email Blackout Dates
- When do you have to apply for the extension? How far in advance?

### Notes

- Host tree part 2, have the mirror be colored by rate?
- Instead of CI intervals, have the timetree subtree with confidence intervals.
- Instead of 4 clades, just do second pandemic and third pandemic.
- Fix the labelling of the second pandemic clade, Branch labels as number of substitutions.
- For a future figures, visualize an HPD on top of the tree.
- Estimating temporal with clades can be accurate and powerful! Moving outside clades (ex. Polytomy) is very unstable, because of rate variation (after regression and subtree, transition to why polytomy is a problem)

### 0930

1. Discuss current status of projects - Kat, Rav and Alisiya
2. Discuss what’s needed to complete them - i.e. next steps for each of them and get input from team members. How quickly to finish/finalize current work
3. Discuss, future plague research - where we should be headed, in this area, given the crowded nature of plague research. Low hanging fruit (or long term project focus) etc. other folks to bring into the fold
4. Other items

#### Notes
- Buddism introduction in the 15th century = burials in fields for birds to come through.
- Mass burials not typical in Mongolia
- [[Alisiya Petrushkevich]] Database, Just need the accession number to link it
- Reoccuring plague meeting
- [[Mongolia Sampling Strategy]]


### 0900
- Discuss presentations for [[Kalamazoo 2021 Conference]]
- Tree, rates, clock calibration, temporal structure in clade
- 2 slides, "how we think about plague", expect an acceleration, then show the real tree, how the ecology explains this, why we need curated data
- Ascertainment bias (John Avis, phylogeography)
- Phylogeography and the dangers thereof

1. Rate Variation
2. Ascertainment Bias

- Rate Variation -> Clocks -> Origins -> Ecology
- Ascertainment Bias in Phylogeography

### Notes

- Present the working draft [Nextstrain Narrative](https://nextstrain.org/community/narratives/ktmeaton/plague-phylogeography-projects@main/main).
- Paper Objectives:
	1. Critical examination of molecular clock models.
	2. Critique of phylogeography models.
- Give some context about the Y. pestis genome (chromosome, plasmids, genes), more context for plague the bacteria and genome.
- Great place to put in Pandemics context, and how many??? How are they defined?? Problems associated
- Why do we care about origins and timing?
- Context for why molecular clock is useful and applicable.
	- Contextualize the past, understand current pandemics and future.
- Why do we care about rate variation and what does it mean? Rate variation as an indicator of adaptation
- pla deletion/loss, human-associated adaptation?
- Rethink ordering of tree vs. models.
- Put number of subs on terminal branches
- Reread the pestis segunda and 
- Discuss the Big Bang Polytomy, and our ability to date or not date it.
- Ask Sebastian about their Big Bang
- Sampling Bias: Subsampling Second Pandemic down to show the instability
- Resampling again, how do we show the instablility. Understandable to the non-specialist
- Figure shematic, comparison left and right, same clade treated different.
- Discuss with Sebastian/Leo about the Country vs. Province geographic location.
- Send Second pandemic tree + map to Nukhet and Ann
	
### Tasks

## [[2021-04-27]]

[Meeting Link](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/86270641220?pwd=OWVGQy9DU3RjVFNrY3BwZHZmamthZz09)

#### 1. How can the molecular clock of [[Yersinia pestis]] be modeled?

- Large degree of rate variation.
- A strict clock is questionable, but estimates are stable (with large variance).
- A relaxed clock is more appropriate, but estimates are unstable.
	
--> Possibly more appropriate to use multiple models, separated by clade? 

#### 2. How can the molecular clock be applied?

- Tip Dating  (ex. archaeological samples)
- Node Dating (ex. splits, pandemics)

#### 3. Geography

- Case example of the second pandemic.

### Tasks

- [[Plague Phylodynamics and Phylogeography Paper]]
- "How does this shift dialogue?"

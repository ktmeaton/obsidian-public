## Introduction

[[Plague]] is an immensely complicated disease and thus a singular ecological model has yet to be entirely embraced by all members of the field. This is primarily due to tremendous ecological diversity, as plague has been associated with human epidemics for thousands of years, has visited every continent except for Antarctica, is thought to be able to infect virtually all mammals, and can be transmitted by hundreds of different species of fleas. The complexity that emerges from this diversity presents many challenges when interpreting both past and present outbreaks of plague. As a result, significant controversy and debate continually emerges over the nature of human plague epidemics. 

Reanalysis of the second pandemic, specifically the Black Death, has produced numerous publications describing ecological inconsistencies between medieval plague and modern outbreaks. The objectives of this paper are therefore to examine contentious aspects of the current ecological model of plague, to understand why these issues emerged, why they have not been resolved, and their implications for interpreting historical epidemics. 

The acceptance or rejection of an ecological model of plague has not been exclusively based upon its robusticity or reproducibility. In many aspects, our current understanding of plague is the product of the sociopolitical and scientific climate in which discoveries were made, and also the extent to which they have been challenged. Of the numerous unresolved questions that persist today, many were apparent to careful observers in the early days of plague research. But at the turn of the nineteenth century, physicians and epidemiologists were dealing with an ever-expanding and worsening pandemic. Consequently, weaknesses and criticism were soon overlooked in favor of a simplified, and more easily testable, model of the disease  [[Hufthammer 2013 Rats Cannot Have\|[@hufthammer2013RatsCannotHave]]]. Because of this contextual dependence, I will examine current consensus and contention with careful attention paid to the historical context in which these issues have evolved from. An understanding of not just what we know about plague ecology, but why we have this knowledge, will improve our ability to identify robust ecological models and new avenues of research.

## Aetological Agent 

###  Discovery 

Of the numerous ecological factors involved, the most readily accepted upon discovery was the aetiological agent, Yersinia pestis. The late 19th century was a "[[Golden Age]]" of bacteriology following [[Robert Koch\|Robert Koch‚Äôs]] revolutionary discovery of the [[Anthrax|anthrax]] bacillus in 1876 [[Blevins 2010 Robert Koch Golden\|[@blevins2010RobertKochGolden]]]. Against this backdrop of medical revolutions, the determination to identify and characterize the microbial nature of plague began in [[Hong Kong]] in 1894 [[Benedictow 2004 Black Death 1346-1353\|[@benedictow2004BlackDeath13461353]]]. While working independently in plague hospitals, bacteriologists [[Alexandre Yersin]] and [[Kitasato Shibasaburo\|Kitasato]] near-simultaneously discovered and cultured the plague bacillus, *[[Yersinia pestis\|Bacterium pestis]]*, from the blood of infected patients [[Yersin 1894\|[@yersin1894;]] [[Kitasato 1894\|@kitasato1894]]]. [[Alexandre Yersin\|Yersin's]] description of the bacterium has generally been considered more accurate and consistent than [[Kitasato Shibasaburo\|Kitasato's]], and thus the bacillus was later renamed *[[Yersinia pestis]]* in recognition [[Benedictow 2004 Black Death 1346-1353\|[@benedictow2004BlackDeath13461353]]]. The [[Alexandre Yersin\|Yersin]]-[[Kitasato Shibasaburo\|Kitasato]] debate continues today, and it is not likely to be concretely solvable given the available evidence. However, later reappraisal suggested that [[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]] may display varied characteristics during a human epidemic [[Bibel 1976 Diagnosis Plaque Analysis\|[@bibel1976DiagnosisPlaqueAnalysis]]], which may in part explain [[Kitasato Shibasaburo\|Kitasato's]] observations.

The morphological heterogeneity of Y. pestis has in fact undergone appreciable examination and review, although it was not initially recognized (Rowland, 1914; Eisler et al., 1958). In addition,recent experimental work suggests that changes in cell morphology may affect the ability to culture, and therefore detect, the presence of Y. pestis (Pawlowski et al., 2011). This work has even moved
to investigating nanoscale morphological changes of Y. pestis in order to explore how external microclimates affect virulence and infection mechanisms (Wang et al., 2016). The full extent of morphological variation of Y. pestis has yet to be characterized and interpreted, but the recent explosion of interest in investigating the biochemical and phylogenetic diversity of Y. pestis has made
great strides in breaking away from the assumption of the homogeneity of the plague bacterium.

### *[[Yersinia pestis]]*

Yersinia pestis is a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family, which includes enteric pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi that are commonly transmitted by contaminated food and water. In comparison, the plague bacterium is unique among this family due to a striking difference in host habitat and transmission. Y. pestis commonly resides in the blood of its mammalian hosts and can be transmitted to new hosts through an infectious fleabite, following extensive colonization of the flea midgut. In addition to these tissues, Y. pestis is also capable of colonizing parts of the mammalian immune system including the lymphatic and reticuloendothelial systems (Gage and Kosoy, 2006). The large diversity of media in which Y. pestis has adapted to colonize is particularly surprising given that it only recently (within the last 20,000 years) diverged as a clone of its parent species, the enteric pathogen Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (Achtman et al., 1999). Despite a close genetic similarity between Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis, sharing 97% gene identity, they differ widely in their transmission and pathogenecity (Chain et al., 2004). Whereas Y. pseudotuberculosis causes gastrointestinal disease and is transmitted by the food-borne route, Y. pestis causes plague and is transmitted between mammalian hosts by rodent fleas. Because of this genetic similarity, an extensive body of research has formed to address how such dramatic ecological diversity emerged so rapidly and how such a complex transmission mechanism may arise from such a low level of nucleotide divergence.

# Weekly Email Check-In

## 2021-09-10

Hi Hendrik,

I'm currently working on a submission-ready draft of the global plague phylogeny paper (Paper #2) which is due to my co-authors end of day September 15! I'm spending one day each updating the following sections:
	- Phylodynamics
	- Phylogeography
	- Conclusion
	- Intro
	- Methods
	
Nature Microbiology does not have strict formatting requirements for initial submissions, other than a Word Doc with lines numbered. So I won't change the formatting substantially at this point in time.

Cheers,
Kat

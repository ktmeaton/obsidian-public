# Volz 2020 Identification Of Hidden Population Structure In Time-Scaled Phylogenies

## Seldon Summary

> - Under a neutral coalescent process, the distribution of coalescent times in two clades ancestral to X and Y will depend on the number of extant lineages through time in both clades and on the effective population size Ne(t)
> - A genealogy simulated from a structured coalescent process with two demes, one of which has constant effective population size (clade highlighted in blue), and the other having effective population size growing exponentially (clades highlighted in red and yellow).
> - Supplementary Algorithm 2 available on Dryad will partition tips of the tree into distinct clades with monophyletic or paraphyletic relationships, however, an approach based on pre-order traversal of the tree cannot on its own arrive at a polyphyletic partition of the tree.
> - For example, using a 95% confidence level, we find a significant difference between clades in 85% of simulations sampling 40 tips from the minority clade and with a 2-fold difference in the rescaled effective population sizes.
> - We simulated paired coalescent trees of different sizes and with different effective population sizes, and each pair of coalescent trees was then joined at a common root.
> - Note that even if the effective population size is the same in the majority and minority clades, the topology of the combined tree may differ substantially from the Kingman model, so that the minority clade may be detected by the treestructure algorithm.
> - Supplementary Figure S4 available on Dryad shows the normalized test statistic for various sample sizes and contrasts of effective population size in two clades descended from the root of a tree.

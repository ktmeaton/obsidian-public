## Introduction

Exploring the impact of infectious diseases on past human populations is a particularly challenging task considering that the skeleton is often the only tissue left preserved in archaeological remains. The main limitation of this tissue is that many infectious diseases do not involve the skeleton (Ortner, 2007) and thus are seeimingly invisible in the archaeological record. Therefore, the integration of additional lines of evidence is needed to explore determinants of health based on both the host and the infectious agent. The field of paleomicrobiology offers a promising opportunity to detect, identify, and characterize ancient pathogens retrieved from preserved tissues. Despite the tremendous progress that has been made in the past 20 years, paleomicrobiology is still in its infancy, and troubled by numerous issues. There is little consensus on what defines a "pathogen" in modern microbiology and clinical settings, let alone in paleomicrobiology where the available data is extremely sparse and degraded. In addition, the exceedingly rapid pace at which advancements in sequencing technology are made have left little time to embrace standardized workflows for interpreting the massive amounts of sequence data generated. This lack of standardization is especially problematic when attempting to identify very low abundance organisms within a sea of highly degraded, and taxonomically diverse, molecules present in archaeological samples. In order for paleomicrobiology to demonstrate its validity and reliability as a discipline, these issues must first receive widespread recognition by all those engaged in research.

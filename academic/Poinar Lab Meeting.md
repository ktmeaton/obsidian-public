# Poinar Lab Meeting

## 2021-09-28

- [[Tyler Murchie]]
- [[Sina Baleka]]
- [[Emil Karpinski]]

- Are we going to switch to NextSeq rather than HiSeq

### General

1. Disease Exposure
	- How do we contract infectious diseases?
	- How do we spread them?
	- Why does this vary across time and space?

1. Disease Experience
	- Does everyone die?
	- Do people survive? Do they pass helpful genes on?
	- Do they create striking artwork to show the anguish?

1. Epidemiology that is most perplexing:
	- Zoonoses (non-human animals -> humans) Ex. COVID
	- Disease Exposure: 
	- Mysterious
	- Substantial amount of life-cycle that is 'invisible' to us
	- lots of ecological variables in play = high levels of uncertainty about disease exposure
	- Public Health: Extremely difficult to predict and control
	- Ex. HIV, Malaria, Influenza, WNV, Rabies, Brucellosis, Lyme Disease
	- Disease Experience: New to humans, immunological naive

1. The Past Informs the Present (Plague)
	- Disease exposure: Expansive geography and time
	- At least 5000 years of association with humans
	- Every continent (except Antarctica)
	- Centuries of historical research
	- Disease Experience: Wicked mortality, societal transformation, quarantine? Plague manual from 1700/1800s
	- Plague is a bacterial disease.
	- Rodents <-> fleas <-> mammals (humans)
	- Lymph (buboes), blood (septicemia), lungs (pneumonia)
	- Longest plague pandemic, lasted 500 years. Why so long? Is COVID going to last that long?

1. Major Disease Exposure:
	- Disease Exposure: 
	- 1st appearance --> Predates written history (Bronze Age)
	- Pandemic origin stories: where and when, and spread (Limited Historical records)
	- Interpandemic: where does it go when its not in humans? (Invisible to the historical record)

### COVID Updates

- Instructional work in the lab = multiple people allowed.
- [[Excel checklist for Responsibilites]]
- Pierre et al. 2020 (EJHG)

### Lab Responsibilities

1. Identify who will be _regularly_ working in the labs.
2. Identify who will be _regularly_ working in the office.
3. Identify who is willing to come into campus for responsibilities.
4. Rapidly transition Emil out of his responsibilities (train new person).
5. Slowly transition anyone who is graduating soon (ex. Kat) out of their responsibilities.

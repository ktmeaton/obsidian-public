# Poinar Lab Meeting

## [[2021-10-19]]

### Notes

#### [[Dirk Hackenberger]]

- **Project:** [[Single Stranded Library Preparation]]
- **Current Problem:** Lots of adapter dimers are forming in his library prep method.
- **Explanation:** Template hopping and low fidelity of [[Bst]].
- **Solution:** Synthesized and purified a new polyermase ([[Phi29]]), with no exonuclease activity.
- **Test**: Rerun protocol with new polymerase. Not great template generation.
- **Next Steps**: More optimization and testing!
- **Image**: Gel, bands at 35 (adapter), 75 (dimer), +? unknown product 

#### [[Tess Wilson]]

- **Project**: [[Single Stranded Library Preparation]]
- Need to scale project back down to fit in 2 yr program,
- Focus on [[Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded\|FFPE]] tissues.
- 6 candidate steps: extraction, quant, depletion, reverse transcription, library prep, enrichment

#### [[Allison]]

- **Projects:**:
	- Targeted capture of [[Antimicrobial Resistance\|AMR]] genes.
	- [[Antimicrobial Resistance\|AMR]] from Ancient Latrines
	- [[Antimicrobial Resistance\|AMR]] in children in Botswana
- **Question:** Do probiotics in infant (pre-terms) prevent AMR genes? 
- **Answer**: No significant differences (quantitative).
- But what about gene type? Potentially probiotics reduces AMR gene diversity.
- Continuing to investigate sulfide genes (sulf1/sulf2) in the latrines.
- Some more work on probe design in the CARD database enrichment. 
- **Image**: Read mapping around the _a_ genes.

### [[NextSeq Sequencing]]

- Benefits: 
	- [[HiSeq]] = deprecated
	- [[NextSeq]] = more data for cheaper!
- Negative:
	- Index hopping, use 100% unique Forward and Reverse indexes.
	- Logistically
	- Pool = 400 pm in 20 uL, regardless of run percentage.
	- Just add more reamp cycles?
	- Do we need to size-select after enrichment?
	- Completely start over for indexes record?
	- Sign-up for indexes for each sequencing run.
- Neither Sina nor Matt have had issues with index overlap.
- Also the [[Hamming Distance]] calculation.
- 2 index sheets, short-term and long-term.
- Index signup sheets, immediate (3 months), long-term (6 months).
- Order 150 more indexes, 250 indexes available for each run.

1. [[Melanie Kuch]] | Ask Christine about how necessary unique indexes are (index-hopping prevalence).
2. [[Melanie Kuch]] | Ask [[Matthias Meyer]] for an additional 150 index combos (total 250).
3. [[Dirk Hackenberger]] | Create new global index sheet. (250 x 250).
4. [[Katherine Eaton]] | Add an extra tab to the run sign-up sheets, index combos. Include a Hamming distance calculator to check for conflicts?
5. Everyone | Each sequencing pool will need a Bioanalyzer. Upload the pdf to MacDrive sequencing folder. We are curious how necessary size-selection is.

- [[Tyler Murchie]]
- [[Sina Baleka]]
- [[Emil Karpinski]]

- Are we going to switch to NextSeq rather than HiSeq

### General

1. Disease Exposure
	- How do we contract infectious diseases?
	- How do we spread them?
	- Why does this vary across time and space?

1. Disease Experience
	- Does everyone die?
	- Do people survive? Do they pass helpful genes on?
	- Do they create striking artwork to show the anguish?

1. Epidemiology that is most perplexing:
	- Zoonoses (non-human animals -> humans) Ex. COVID
	- Disease Exposure: 
	- Mysterious
	- Substantial amount of life-cycle that is 'invisible' to us
	- lots of ecological variables in play = high levels of uncertainty about disease exposure
	- Public Health: Extremely difficult to predict and control
	- Ex. HIV, Malaria, Influenza, WNV, Rabies, Brucellosis, Lyme Disease
	- Disease Experience: New to humans, immunological naive

1. The Past Informs the Present (Plague)
	- Disease exposure: Expansive geography and time
	- At least 5000 years of association with humans
	- Every continent (except Antarctica)
	- Centuries of historical research
	- Disease Experience: Wicked mortality, societal transformation, quarantine? Plague manual from 1700/1800s
	- Plague is a bacterial disease.
	- Rodents <-> fleas <-> mammals (humans)
	- Lymph (buboes), blood (septicemia), lungs (pneumonia)
	- Longest plague pandemic, lasted 500 years. Why so long? Is COVID going to last that long?

1. Major Disease Exposure:
	- Disease Exposure: 
	- 1st appearance --> Predates written history (Bronze Age)
	- Pandemic origin stories: where and when, and spread (Limited Historical records)
	- Interpandemic: where does it go when its not in humans? (Invisible to the historical record)



## 2021-09-14

### COVID Updates

- Instructional work in the lab = multiple people allowed.
- [[Lab Responsibilities]]
- Pierre et al. 2020 (EJHG)

### Lab Responsibilities

1. Identify who will be _regularly_Â working in the labs.
2. Identify who will beÂ _regularly_Â working in the office.
3. Identify who is willing to come into campus for responsibilities.
4. Rapidly transition Emil out of his responsibilities (train new person).
5. Slowly transition anyone who is graduating soon (ex. Kat) out of their responsibilities.

## 2021-08-17

- Upload proof of vaccination soon.
- In-person meetings resume September 14, possible in Wilson Buildling.

### Notes

- Variables to explain temporal structure: epidemics, host, genetic pairwise distances, how the data was divided

- There are a lot more genomic samples available for [[Yersinia pestis]].
- Expanded temporal and geographic scope.
- We know that historical calibrations are crucial for organisms with rate heterogeneity.
- There are a lot more ancient DNA calibrations, from skeletal remains in pre-modern populations.
- But also there are a lot more calibrations available from the modern period. Culture sequencing of 20th century isolates.

The explosion of [[Yersinia pestis]] sequencing in the last X years excites me for two reasons:
1. More calibration points, in both pre-modern periods and the 20th century.
	- Break up long internal branches,
2. More geographic points sampled! To help correct sampling biases.


- Combination of demographic history and sampling history.

## Outcomes

1. No Temporal Signal
	- [[1.IN]]
	- [[2.ANT]]
	- [[3.ANT]]
2. Temporal Signal with conflicting node dates
	- [[0.PE]]
	- [[2.ANT]]
	- [[3.ANT]]

- Good temporal

## No Temporal Signal

- [[1.IN]]
- [[2.ANT]]
- [[3.ANT]]
- [[4.ANT]] Maybe?

What do they have in common?

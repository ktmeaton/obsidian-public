Thus far, the hypotheses proposed to explain this variation have primarily focused on ecological processes, such as the cycling between endemic and epidemic phases [@cui2013HistoricalVariationsMutation] and geographic expansions over large distances [Spyrou 2019 Phylogeography Second Plague|@spyrou2019PhylogeographySecondPlague]. However, we argue that several methodological factors must first be taken into account, before investigating more complex ecological factors such as host and landscape.

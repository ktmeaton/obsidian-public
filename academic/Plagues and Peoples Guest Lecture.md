## Land Acknowledgement

<hr>

<grid  drag="80 30" drop="10 20" flow="col">
_I acknowledge the traditional land on which I reside, is in Treaty Six Territory. I would like to thank the diverse Indigenous Peoples whose ancestorsâ€™ footsteps have marked this territory for centuries, such as nÃªhiyaw, DenÃ©, Anishinaabe, Nakota Isga, and Niitsitapi peoples. I also acknowledge this as the MÃ©tisâ€™ homeland and the home of one of the largest communities of Inuit south of the 60th parallel._

## 7 Deadliest Plagues

note: This infographic comes from an article by Prabu and Gergen (2021). I like it because...
The X-axis is a timeline, going from 500 CE to present day. And the Y-axis is how long the series of epidemics lasted.
Black Death is eye-catching.
- What is missing are the pandemic durations.

## What is... Plague?

<grid  drag="45 80" drop="1 17" flow="col" border="2px solid black">

### Plague

_Yersinia pestis_

- Bacteria
- Lymphatic Disease
- Rare inter-human transmission
- Slow evolution:<br>
	1 mutation / 10 years

</grid>

<grid  drag="45 80" drop="-1 17" flow="col" border="2px solid black">

### COVID

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2

- Virus
- Respiratory Disease
- Inter-human transmission
- Rapid evolution:<br>
	2 mutations / month


</grid>

## Are We Sure?

<hr>

- **Problem:** Diagnosing disease is <u>hard</u>.

> ### You wake up sneezing, with a sore throat and a cough.<br>
> ### Do you have COVID? Or a cold? Or a flu? Or fatigue?

- Retrospective diagnosis of 1000+ year old diseases is <u>really hard</u>.
- Ambiguous descriptions of "pestilence", inconsistent symptoms, regional variation, etc. (McMillen, 2016, p. 26-27)

## A Larger Study

<hr>

[Eaton et al.](https://ktmeaton.github.io/obsidian-public/academic/Eaton_et_al._2021_Plague_in_Denmark_1000-1800.html)<br>
Plague in Denmark (1000-1800): A longitudinal study of _Yersinia pestis_

- We extracted DNA from ~300 skeletal remains.
- 13 archaeological sites: <u>1000 CE - 1800 CE</u>
- Historical evidence of _pestilence_: <u>1350 CE - 1650 CE</u>
- We screened the DNA for plague-specific molecules (_Y. pestis_).

---

## Results

<hr>

- DNA evidence <u>perfectly aligns</u> with the historical evidence.
- INSERT TIMELINE IMAGE.
- Where is _Y. pestis_ before the Black Death?
- Why did this plague pandemic end?

## Experience and Response

<hr>

> ### " _After the Black Death, loss of life on such a scale was not seen again._" 
> ### - McMillen (2016, p. 18)

> ### _"Over the centuries Europeans adapted to the plague, even came to expect it, and developed ways of dealing with it ... it became a regular feature of life in many places."_

Why Werenâ€™t These Black Death Victims Buried in Mass Graves?<br>

> "...emergency cemeteries and mass burials are atypical, with most plague victims instead receiving individual burial in normal cemeteries..."

- Early research focused on catastrophe, societal upheaval, "deviant" practices.
- Starting to realize these examples are not representative.
- There is now a greater focus on <u>diverse practices</u> and <u>resilience</u>.
- How do people create stability to uphold their values?

### Plague

McMillen (2016)

>  "...plague preyed more upon the poor than the rich."

> ...the dearth of laborers forced the abbot and the lord of the manor to enter into a new
labor agreement with the tenants with far more favorable terms.

> â€œservants are now masters and masters are servants"

Is Covid-19 Restructuring The Job Market?

> "...pre-pandemic labor market inequalities remain high and have even worsened by some measures, especially for those in lower-paying jobs."

> "So teleworking has grown in importance, but it remains concentrated among professionals with higher education"

[Markovitz (2021)](https://time.com/5974430/wealth-tax-covid-19/)<br>
America's 1% Got Way Richer During the Pandemic

> "...the disease highlights and worsens existing fault lines in American society, especially economic inequality."

### Plague

[Klunk et al. (Submitted)]()<br>
Black Death shaped the evolution of immune genes

> The Black Death actually changed human biology. Those that survived had particular mutations in their immune system.

> However, these same mutations, "are today associated with increased susceptibility to autoimmune diseases"

[Frangou (2022)](https://www.macleans.ca/longforms/chronic-exhaustion-derailed-lives-and-no-way-out-this-is-long-covid/)<br>
Chronic exhaustion, derailed lives and<br> no way out. This is long COVID.

> "Almost one year after getting COVID, she still wrestles with a cough, cognitive dysfunction, pain and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome..."

> "...about 10 per cent of Canadians who contract COVID-19 will suffer prolonged symptoms."

## The Pathogen

<hr>

> ### How does a bacteria/virus change during a pandemic?

- The hunt begins! For DNA mutations that could explain why the <u>Black Death was so fatal</u>: 75-200 million deaths.
- Problem: (_Y. pestis_) evolves <u>really</u> slowly ( 1 mutation / 10 years).
- There is no "smoking gun", no answers in the DNA of _Y. pestis._
- Until...

[Susat et al. (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-71530-9)<br>_Yersinia pestis_ strains from Latvia show depletion of the _pla_ virulence gene

- Plague (_Y. pestis_) can shuffle it's DNA around like a deck of cards!

> ### The loss of a virulence gene may "have contributed to the disappearance of the second plague pandemic".

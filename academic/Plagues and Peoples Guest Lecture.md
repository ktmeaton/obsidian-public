## Land Acknowledgement


<grid  drag="80 30" drop="10 20" flow="col">
_I acknowledge the traditional land on which I reside, is in Treaty Six Territory. I would like to thank the diverse Indigenous Peoples whose ancestorsâ€™ footsteps have marked this territory for centuries, such as nÃªhiyaw, DenÃ©, Anishinaabe, Nakota Isga, and Niitsitapi peoples. I also acknowledge this as the MÃ©tisâ€™ homeland and the home of one of the largest communities of Inuit south of the 60th parallel._

## Showdown

<grid  drag="43 80" drop="5 17" flow="col" border="2px solid black">

### Plague

_Yersinia pestis_

- Black Death (1356-1353)<br>
	75-200 Million Dead

- Third

- Slow evolution:<br>
	1 mutation / 10 years

</grid>

<grid  drag="43 80" drop="-5 17" flow="col" border="2px solid black">

### COVID-19

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2

## Experience and Response

<hr>

>" _After the Black Death, loss of life on such a scale was not seen again._" McMillen (2016, p. 18)

> _"Over the centuries Europeans adapted to the plague, even came to expect it, and developed ways of dealing with it ... it became a regular feature of life in many places."_ McMillen (2016, p. 10)

> "This burial included the remains of at least 48 men, women, and children, who had clearly been struck down during a single catastrophic event."<br><br>
> "Throughout the grave, the dead were deposited and treated with great care."

### COVID-19

> "His father's body was among a group of bodies the government intended to bury in a field near Baghdad, outside the city." <br><br>
> "...paramilitary forces in hazmat suits took over the process and conducted the burials according to Islamic rites at a sprawling cemetery in the holy city Najaf"

### [After the Plague](http://www.aftertheplague.com/)

![[@cessford2021BeyondPlaguePits_Figure.PNG|250]]

[Gershon (2021)](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/some-black-death-victims-were-buried-care-not-mass-graves-180978025/)<br>
Why Werenâ€™t These Black Death Victims Buried in Mass Graves?<br>

> "...individual people were being buried with considerable care and attention..." <br><br>
> "...emergency cemeteries and mass burials are atypical, with most plague victims instead receiving individual burial in normal cemeteries..."

</grid>

<grid  drag="45 80" drop="-5 17" flow="col">
- Initially focused on catastrophe and adaptation. "Deviant" burial practices.

- Realized these are not representative.

- Equally interesting to focus on diversity, and resilience. How did people maintain their practices?

### Plague

McMillen (2016)

>  "...plague preyed more upon the poor than the rich."

> ...the dearth of laborers forced the abbot and the lord of the manor to enter into a new
labor agreement with the tenants with far more favorable terms.

> â€œservants are now masters and masters are servants"

### COVID-19

[McGahey (2021)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardmcgahey/2021/10/29/is-covid-19-restructuring-the-job-market/?sh=1773a8348c60)<br>
Is Covid-19 Restructuring The Job Market?

> "...pre-pandemic labor market inequalities remain high and have even worsened by some measures, especially for those in lower-paying jobs."

> "So teleworking has grown in importance, but it remains concentrated among professionals with higher education"

[Markovitz (2021)](https://time.com/5974430/wealth-tax-covid-19/)<br>
America's 1% Got Way Richer During the Pandemic

> "...the disease highlights and worsens existing fault lines in American society, especially economic inequality."

### Immunity

[Klunk et al. (Submitted)]()<br>
Black Death shaped the evolution of immune genes

> The Black Death actually changed human biology. Those that survived had particular mutations in their immune system.

> However, these same mutations, "are today associated with increased susceptibility to autoimmune diseases"

## Pandemic Response

> In Alexandria, Egypt, rather than forcing people to adhere to strict public health measures, health
officials enlisted local leaders to gain the trust and cooperation of the citizenry.

### Why Study Past Pandemics?

- To seek comfort, in making the unknown familiar.
- To find a way forward, in learning from our mistakes.

### "Origins" (cause by what, where, when, why?)

> "It is a disease we now know to be caused by a bacillus, Yersinia pestis ..." 
> "It first appeared in the sixth century CE when the first identifiable pandemic occurred during the Byzantine Empire."
> \- McMillen (2016, p. 7)

>_"It first appeared in the historical record in 1346 in the Black Sea port of Kaffa and spread inexorably across Europe."_
> \- McMillen (2016, p. 10)

> How can we know whether or not the disease that visited Constantinople in 542, Avignon in 1349, and London in 1665 was the same disease now known to be caused by Yersinia pestis? Some historians and biologists say they are not and stress possible differences in virulence; they claim that rats could not have traveled as fast as was necessary to spread the plague so quickly
> \- McMillen (2016, p. 26)

> By now, most historians, geneticists, and molecular biologists support the idea that the plague has always been Y. pestis. One reason for this is the emerging evidence from DNA sources originating in graves from antiquity, as well as from the late medieval and early modern periods.
> \- McMillen (2016, p. 27)

### Pandemic "Experience"
- Long drawn out

> _After the Black Death, loss of life on such a scale was not seen again._
> \- McMillen (2016, p. 18)

> _"Over the centuries Europeans adapted to the plague, even came to expect it, and developed ways of dealing with it."_
> \- McMillen (2016, p. 10)

> _"People became accustomed to plague as it became a regular feature of life in many places."_
> \- McMillen (2016, p. 10)

- How do pathogens (viruses, bacteria) evolve throughout a pandemic?
- How does this affect their transmissibility, symptoms, severity?

### Pandemic Response (public health measure)
- Burials, graves

> _"What they might have reflected and reinforced, however, was an emerging association between poverty and disease."_
> ... plague preyed more upon the poor than the rich.
> \- McMillen (2016, p. 20)


> _"...a move toward quarantine and isolation of both people and goods, travel restrictions, prohibitions on public gatherings"_
> boards of health enforced laws regarding public health in times of plague. 
> They had little effect; plague still came."_
> \- McMillen (2016, p. 20)

> Plague became a social problem. It took on meaning as a symbol of the divide between rich and poor. Fear of the plague and fear of the poor went hand in hand.
> \- McMillen (2016, p. 21)


> Not all states adopted quarantine with equal vigor. Those that did were in closer proximity to the sources of plague.
> \- McMillen (2016, p. 21)

> In theory, household quarantine of the sick was a good idea; in practice it did little: plague victims disregarded orders to stay put, and there were simply too many of them. Quarantine as a public health measure and its effect on commerce would come under considerable fire in the eighteenth century as it increasingly began to seem like a holdover from a less enlightened time.
> \- McMillen (2016, p. 21)

> most of the strategies deployed against cholera had been developed during the second plague pandemic.
> \- McMillen (2016, p. 23)

> experience with pandemic cholera influence the ways in which the third plague pandemic would be managed
> \- McMillen (2016, p. 23)





> s. By then the focus had shifted to rats as the carrier of the disease, which in turn led to a focus on stopping plague at the ports of departure.
> \- McMillen (2016, p. 28)

### Concepts

- When and where has this disease appeared in the past?
- Where did it "originate"?
- How did it spread? Local re-introductions, vs. persistence?
	- Community Transmission, "Imported", ""
	- Border policy
- How did it affect the people? (ex. Mortality)
- How did the people respond?

### The Big Problems

- How do we put multi-dicsiplinary evidence together?
- Different information and resolution
	- History: Case Records (where and when)
	- Genetic: Pathogen relationships
	- Ecologists: Climate change (tree ring data)
- No One Discipline can do it alone

- Tree Ring Data: Seasonal, Annual Growth Ring

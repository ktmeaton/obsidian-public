## [[obsidian-public/academic/BEAST]]

An issue I'm pondering currently is visualizing large complex datasets in [[spreaD3]]. I'm curious if I can do a BEAST run on the whole phylogeny (~630 samples) and then extract subtrees from there for plotting.

I'm testing out several BEAST things:

- GEO_SPHERE
- CoupledMCMC
- Tip priors (Marseille and East-Smithfield)
- I can't remember how I installed Beauti packages...

# Rambaut et al. (2020) A Dynamic Nomenclature Proposal for SARS-CoV-2 Lineages to Assist Genomic Epidemiology

## Summary

> Automatically created by [`seldon`](https://github.com/ktmeaton/seldon).

- We defined further SARS-CoV-2 lineages, each  descending from either lineage A or B, and assigned a numerical  value (for example, lineage A.1 or lineage B.2).
- We also describe 16 lineages directly derived  from lineage B. To date, lineage B.1 is the predominant known  global lineage and has been subdivided into >70 sublineages.
- We have suggested a  genome coverage threshold for proposing new lineages and we further suggest that sequences are not ascribed a lineage designation  unless the genome coverage of that sequence exceeds 70% of the  coding region.
- Lineage designations  were made using the following set of conditions: (1) each descendant lineage should show phylogenetic evidence of emergence from  an ancestral lineage into another geographically distinct population,  implying substantial onward transmission in that population.
- A unique and important aspect of our proposed nomenclature  is that the status of the currently circulating lineages be assessed  at regular intervals, with decisions made about identifying new  lineages and flagging those we believe are likely be unobserved or  inactive because none of their members have been sequenced for  a considerable time.

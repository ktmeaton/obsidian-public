# Brozou 2021 Leprosy In Medieval Denmark: Exploring Life Histories Through A Multi-Tissue And Multi-Isotopic Approach

## Seldon Summary

> - Individuals from the two [[Denmark\|Danish]] [[Leprosy\|leprosy]] hospitals have higher [[δ15N]] values (Table 5), which could indicate either a relatively larger consumption of aquatic or terrestrial protein for the [[Denmark\|Danish]] [[Leprosy\|leprosy]] patients, and/or a [[δ15N]] value increase in the Danish baseline that could be linked to different manuring and husbandry practices.
> - Noteworthy, the diet of leprosy patients from all four leprosy sites show small contributions of protein from aquatic resources, which is also evident for the leprosy patients from medieval Barcelona, Spain (Montes et al., 2018).
> - The same dietary picture for the [[Leprosy\|leprosy]] patients from [[Odense]] is also shown by the [[Stable Isotope\|isotope]] values of Figure 2. Stable carbon and nitrogen [[Stable Isotope\|isotope]] data of animal samples from the site of [[Vilhelm Werners Plads]] in [[Odense]] and of the humans from the two leprosy hospitals.
> - Despite the admission regulations for [[Denmark\|Danish]] [[Leprosy\|leprosy]] hospitals, which entailed a local origin and/or residency for the leprosy patients, certain situations (such as the inability of a specific leprosarium to care for additional patients) may have obliged [[Leprosy\|leprosy]] sufferers to seek a suitable place in a more distant [[Leprosy\|leprosy]] hospital.
> - With the aim to investigate whether the [[Diet\|diet]] of the leprosy patients may reflect their hospitalization or the regional dietary habits, we explored [[Stable Isotope\|isotopically]] [[Medieval\|medieval]] [[Denmark\|Danish]] diets of contemporary populations from the wider vicinity of the leprosy hospitals ([[Ringsted]], [[Skælskør]], [[Odense]]—[[St. Knud]]'s and [[St. Alban]]'s churches).
> - A terrestrial-based diet is further indicated by the sulfur isotope values of leprosy patients from the [[Odense]] [[Leprosarium\|Leprosarium]].
> - Because both leprosy hospitals are located in the eastern part of [[Denmark]] ([[Odense]] on [[Funen]] and [[Næstved]] on [[Zealand]]), [[Strontium\|strontium]] isotope values in tooth enamel between the range of 0.7089–0.7108 could potentially suggest a local origin for the analyzed leprosy patients.

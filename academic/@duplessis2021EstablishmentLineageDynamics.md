# du Plessis et al. (2021) Establishment and Lineage Dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 Epidemic in the UK

## Summary

> Automatically created by [`seldon`](https://github.com/ktmeaton/seldon).

- However, the lineage size distribution is strongly skewed and follows a power-law distribution (Fig. 2C, inset), such that the eight largest UK transmission lineages contain >25% of all sampled UK genomes (Fig. 2D; figs.
- S8 and S9); whereas UK transmission lineages containing >100 genomes consistently accounted for >40% of weekly sampled genomes, the proportion of small transmission lineages (≤10 genomes) and singletons decreased over the course of the epidemic (Fig. 3A).
- To be detected, a UK transmission lineage must contain two or more sampled genomes; singletons are not classified here as UK transmission lineages.
- Note that only half of the cases in the top UK transmission lineage are observed, and the bottom UK transmission lineage is unobserved.
- Colored boxes next to lineage names are as depicted in Fig. 2D. RESEARCH | RESEARCH ARTICLE Downloaded from https://www.science.org on March 03, 2022 transmission lineages, and larger lineages were more geographically widespread.

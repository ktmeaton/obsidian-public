# Duchêne 2019 Inferring Infectious Disease Phylodynamics With Notification Data


## Summary

- I expect this to be helpful with regards to [[Sampling Bias|sampling bias]] and [[Sequence-Free|sequence-free]] samples.

## Seldon Summary

> - Evolutionary rate estimate  with notification data were less accurate than those from the complete data, with 88 accurate  analyses using the birth-death and using the coalescent exponential.
> - Using simulations, we demonstrate that birth-death phylodynamic models can capitalise on notification data to eliminate bias in estimates of the basic reproductive number,  R0, particularly when the sampling rate varies over time.
> - Importantly, estimates of Re using complete sampling or notifications are overall  similar in magnitude to those from large-scale epidemiological studies (Fraser et al. 2009;  Biggerstaff et al. 2014), and previous estimates using genome sequence data (Hedge et al. 2013).
> - Combining notification and sequence data can be particularly useful in situations where it is unknown whether sequence sampling has been constant over time or where there exist several  198  confirmed cases but a smaller number of sequences.
> - Because we do not expect constant exponential  growth for these data, we used a birth-death skyline model to estimate the reproductive number, Re  (similar to R0, but not assuming a fully susceptible population), on a monthly basis from January to October.
> - Phylodynamic models can  take advantage of pathogen genome sequence data to infer epidemiological dynamics, such as those based on the exponential growth coalescent and the birth-death process.
> - Analyses of data sets with late sampling using a birth-death model produced inaccurate estimates of R0.

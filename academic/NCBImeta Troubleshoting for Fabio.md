# NCBImeta Troubleshoting for Fabio

> Hi Fabio,
>
> I've released a new update of NCBImeta to fix this bug, thank you for documenting it! The new release is v0.8.1 and is available on Github and PyPI. The conda package will likely take ~24 hours to build and update. If you're able to update on your system, could I ask you to update NCBImeta to the new version v0.8.1?
> 
> Note that I stripped the .py extension from the executable, so your command will now be:
> ```NCBImeta --flat --config example/config_salmonella.yaml```
>
> If you're not able to update, or just want the results, I've attached the output for your configuration file to this email. This includes the salmonella database in sqlite and text format, as well as the log file during running.
>
> Cheers,
> Katherine

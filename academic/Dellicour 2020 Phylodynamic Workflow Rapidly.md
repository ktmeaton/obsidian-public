## Summary

This paper was cited by [[Duchene et al. 2020 Impact Early Public|Duchene et al. 2020]].

The authors propose a [[Phylodynamics]] workflow for large and complex genomic datasets. While Bayesian [[Phylogeography|phylogeographic]] inference is the gold standard, this approach is extremely computationally intensive. Instead, the authors advocate using [[TreeTime]] to create an initial time-scaled tree, which is then used as a fixed empirical tree for [[BEAST]] phylogeography inference.

Workflow steps:
1. Create a time-scaled phylogeny with [[TreeTime]].
1. Run a preliminary discrete phylogeographic analysis to count the introduction. This was done as a binary (internal Belgium, outside). MCMC chain on empiricla tree for 10^6 generations, sampled every 1000.
1. Run a continuous phylogeography analysis, using [[Relaxed Random Walk]].
1. Perform distinct continuous phylogeography on each clade with a subtree.
1. Use the [[R]] package [[seraphim]] for post-analysis and visualization. 

>  We verified the robustness of our estimates through a subsampling procedure consisting of re-computing the weighted dispersal velocity after having randomly discarded 25% of branches in each of the 1,000 posterior trees.
1. To test the robustness of the workflow, they did the whole analysis 5 times over using different starting seeds in IQTREE. Then estimates are reported for various statistics.

# 2021-04-03 Scratch

I'm reading the [[TimeTree]] paper and getting some ideas. 
1. I should read the log closely, and possibly change the verbosity level.
	- #✨ | [[2021-04-05]] | Change log verbosity to level 3.
1. Try the rerooting options, since the linear regression is vaguely promising.
	- #✨ | [[2021-04-05]] | Experiment with rerooting methods.
1. I want to be able to plot the marginal probability distribution for a node (given the tree, ancestral sequence assignment, evolutionary model).
	- #✨ | [[2021-04-05]] | Plot marginal distribution of nodes.
1. Save the GTR model info to file.
	- #✨ | [[2021-04-05]] | Export GTR model to file (tt.gtr)
1. Try to use ```fixed_pi``` to correct the frequencies.
	- #✨ | [[2021-04-05]] | Experiment with fixed_pi.	
1. Troubleshoot GTR substitution model.
	- #✨ | [[2021-04-06]] | Troubleshoot GTR model.
1. Check polytomy resolution, it looked like the big bang polytomy wasn't resolved?
	- #✨  | [[2021-04-06]] | Check polytomy resolution.
1. Check if clock model is converging and how many iterations.
	- #✨ | [[2021-04-06]] | Test max_iter = 10. 
1. I'd like to take detailed notes on this paper.
	- #✨ | [[2021-04-06]] | Take notes on [[TreeTime]].
1. Try to add extra length to the root before exporting. Probably after the ```clock_model``` step. This would help with actually clicking on the root mode in [[Auspice]].
	- #✨ | [[2021-04-12]] | Figure out where to extend root.

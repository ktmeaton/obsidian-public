# Obermeyer et al. (2021) Analysis of 2.1 Million SARS-CoV-2 Genomes Identifies Mutations Associated with Transmissibility

## Summary

> Automatically created by [`seldon`](https://github.com/ktmeaton/seldon).

- The trained model can be used to infer lineage growth rates, predict the growth rate of completely new lineages, forecast future lineage proportions, and estimate the effects of individual mutations on transmissibility.
- Because it assesses the contribution of individual mutations and aggregates across all lineages and geographic regions, it can identify mutations and gene regions that likely drive transmissibility, and it can predict the relative growth rate of new lineages based solely on viral sequence.
- The model correctly inferred B.1.617.2 to have the highest growth rate to date, 2.6-fold (95% CI, 2.27-2.97) higher than the original A lineage (Figure 2 inset); similar growth rates were estimated for its sub-lineages AY.1 and AY.2 (Table 1).
- We set out to formulate a principled approach to modeling the apparent transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 lineages, estimating their growth rate as a proxy for transmissibility and explicitly modeling it as a linear combination of the effects of individual mutations.
- This is possible with SARS-CoV-2 because of the high rate of convergent evolution (Table 1, Figure S4), which allows the model to infer the growth rate of new constellations of mutations based on the trajectories of other lineages in which they have previously emerged.

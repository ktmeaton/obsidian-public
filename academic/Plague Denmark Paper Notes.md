# Plague Denmark Paper Notes

## Feedback

### [[Katherine Eaton]]

- [ ] For anything about phylogeography/spread/directionarlity, create a geographic distribution summary.
- Different levels of information:
	- Full range of site (Viking -> Early Modern)
	- Known occupation range of excavated site
	- Arm position.

### [[Brian Golding]]

- [ ] Introduction: Before you get to methods and results, the types of methods to analyze spatial genetic models needs a short paragraph (helps to limit the methods that need be considered)
- [ ] Map: Split the Ribe 101 number into the two time frames.
- [ ] Phylogeny: Russia is long?
- [ ] Explain the K3Pu+F+I model
- [ ] Rerun the tip-dating just on priors

### [[Hendrik Poinar]]

- [ ] Add sharon dewitte and michelle ziegler
- [ ] Add "total" row to the master summary table.
- [ ] Revise the "positivity" calculation, specifically the "plague-negative" exclusion sites is problematic.
- [ ] When interpreting plague negative, link to the historical documentation that supports it.
- [ ] Is there a positive correlation between human and plague DNA?
- [ ] Why are some of the plasmid coverages way higher?
- [ ] Move clock model summary to SOM.
- [ ] Cite Global plague paper when talking about dating.
- [ ] For all DNA dates, include the 95% CI.
- [ ] Summary Table of dates, differentiate skeletal vs dna vs site vs radiocarbon
- [ ] Phylogeny: the interpretation of multiple waves is not strongly supported by the data.
- [ ] Merge the Second Pandemic sample map with the Danish site distribution.
- [ ] Rethink the pestis secunda interpretation.
- [ ] Pick phase or period.

### [[Sebastian Duchene]]

- [ ] Re-examine dating section.
- [ ] GSS not in BEAST2? [Discussion Forum](https://groups.google.com/g/beast-users/c/nGivwwqKRgM)
- [ ] Read about stepping stone vs. path sampling

### [[Jennifer Klunk]]

- [ ] Introduction: What is the central question and hypothesis we're exploring?
- [ ] Results: Short methods summary beforehand?
- [ ] Introduce the publicly available samples, and why they were chosen.
- [ ] Multiple strains of Yp in G371?
- [ ] What is no skeletal date? For some individuals, I have an arm position from Julia. Some don't.

## Map

1. Outgroup [[0.ANT3]] (China/Kyrgystan)
2. Second Pandemic Samples (Europe)
3. New Genomes (Denmark)

## Notes

- Remove the Viking-age samples.
- Remove the timeline phylogeny.
- There is no monophyletic Danish clade.

## Conclusions

> 1. **The presence of _[[Yersinia pestis]]_ in Denmark aligns with historical documentation of the Second Plague Pandemic. (Confirmation) ** <br>
	> - _[[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]]_ was detected in Denmark throughout the 14<sup>th</sup> to 17<sup>th</sup> centuries CE.
	> - No evidence of _[[Yersinia pestis\|Y. pestis]]_ was found in the centuries immediately preceding the Black Death (11<sup>th</sup> to 13<sup>th</sup> century CE).
	> - No evidence of _[[Yersinia pestis\|Y. pestis]]_ was found in the centuries following the last documented plague outbreak on the mainland (18<sup>th</sup> century CE).
	> --> Still unknown whether it was present in earlier periods (Justinian, Bronze Age).
	> --> Specifically, temporal and geographic patterns are observed that follow the documentation of successive epidemics sweeping across Europe, such as the primary (Black Death), secondary (*pestis secunda)*, and tertiary (*pestis tertia*) waves.

Visual:
- A. Site Occupation Dates
- B. Skeletal samples.
- Distribution of all skeletal sample dates.
- Distribution of plague-positive sample dates (tip HPD, skeletal, radiocarbon).
- For simplicity, assume uniform distribution of sample dates.
	



> 2. ** _[[Yersinia pestis]]_ was detected across diverse individuals and mortuary practices. (Discourse Shift)**. <br>
> - Plague was identified in both adults and sub-adults, rural and urban settlements, and in single and multiple burials. 
> - This finding contributes to discourse on epidemic mortuary practices, which have primarily focused on the practice of mass graves and plague pits such as those observed in large centres such as London.

4. ***[[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]]* in pre-modern Denmark (16th century) forms a geographically-restricted lineage with other samples collected from the Baltic countries and the Alps.** This unique geographic structure supports the theory concerning formation of a novel plague reservoir.

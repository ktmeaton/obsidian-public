# Plague Denmark Paper Notes

## Map

1. Outgroup [[0.ANT3]] (China/Kyrgystan)
2. Second Pandemic Samples (Europe)
3. New Genomes (Denmark)

## Notes

- Maybe remove the Viking-age samples?

## Conclusions

> 1. **The presence of _[[Yersinia pestis]]_ in Denmark aligns with historical documentation of the Second Plague Pandemic. (Confirmation) ** <br>
	> - _[[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]]_ was detected in Denmark throughout the 14<sup>th</sup> to 17<sup>th</sup> centuries CE.
	> - No evidence of _[[Yersinia pestis\|Y. pestis]]_ was found in the centuries immediately preceding the Black Death (11<sup>th</sup> to 13<sup>th</sup> century CE).
	> - No evidence of _[[Yersinia pestis\|Y. pestis]]_ was found in the centuries following the last documented plague outbreak on the mainland (18<sup>th</sup> century CE).
	> --> Still unknown whether it was present in earlier periods (Justinian, Bronze Age).
	> --> Specifically, temporal and geographic patterns are observed that follow the documentation of successive epidemics sweeping across Europe, such as the primary (Black Death), secondary (*pestis secunda)*, and tertiary (*pestis tertia*) waves.

- For simplicity, assume uniform distribution of sample dates.
	



> 2. ** _[[Yersinia pestis]]_ was detected across diverse individuals and mortuary practices. (Discourse Shift)**. <br>
> - Plague was identified in both adults and sub-adults, rural and urban settlements, and in single and multiple burials. 
> - This finding contributes to discourse on epidemic mortuary practices, which have primarily focused on the practice of mass graves and plague pits such as those observed in large centres such as London.

4. ***[[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]]* in pre-modern Denmark (16th century) forms a geographically-restricted lineage with other samples collected from the Baltic countries and the Alps.** This unique geographic structure supports the theory concerning formation of a novel plague reservoir.

## Summary

- The human flea _Pulex irritans_ can be infected with plague. 30% of fleas maintained high bacterial loads for up to 20 days.
- However, transmission during this time was infrequent and inefficient.
- The transmission is at its highest when intermittently feeding on rat blood.
- The rat flea _Xenopsylla cheopis_ has far higher vector competency.
- _Pulex irritans_ digests and clears blood meals rapidly.

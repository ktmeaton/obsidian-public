# Introduction

In 2011, I discovered a researcher named Dr. Hendrik Poinar. His team had just published a seminal paper, in which they identified the causative agent of the infamous "Black Death" [@bos2011DraftGenomeYersinia]. I quickly learned that this morbidly-named event described a pandemic that devastated the world in the 14^th^ century, with unprecedented mortality and spread. In less than 10 years (1346-1353) the Black Death swept across Afro-Eurasia, killing 50% of the population [@cite]. With an estimated global mortality of 200 million people [@sampath2021PandemicsThroughoutHistory], the Black Death is considered to be the most fatal pandemic in human history.


... continue for 500 years ... never truly left.

, and remains one of the most mysterious.

The epidemiology of this medieval disease was cryptic, leading to significant debate among historians of medicine [@cite]. On one hand, historical descriptions seem to incriminate _plague_ [@cite], a zoonotic disease that passes from rodents to humans and leads to grotesquely swollen lymph nodes (buboes). On the other hand, the rapid spread of the Black Death suggested this was a contagion capable of _human-to-human_ transmission, which more closely fit the profile of a virus such as Ebola [@scott2001BiologyPlaguesEvidence]. Others still

At the time of Dr. Poinar's exciting publication, I was completing my Bachelors degree in forensic anthropology.

- This dissertation is the culmination of my fascination with infectious diseases.
- Particularly zoonotic diseases, as their epidemiology is cryptic, often invisible in the historical record.
- Plague is the king of zoonoses, super long history.
- In genetics papers, we like to introduce how historical records are "sparse", "ambiguous", in order to hype up the gaps that we're tackling. But the reality is that they're is an abundance of historical evidence of plague. Such striking symptoms.
- In 2019, pandemics changed from an intellectual passion to a live experience.
- The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic.

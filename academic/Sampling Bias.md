# Sampling Bias

Here I'm working on the concept of [[Sampling Bias]] from [[Rasmussen 2015 Early Divergent Strains]].

## Concepts

- [[Even Sample]]
- [[Over-Represented]]
- [[Under-represented]]
- 
## Methods

- [[Resampling#Bootstrap]]
- [[Resampling#Jacknife]]

## Notes

- I have an idea about variance saturation. [[Resampling#Bootstrap|Bootstrapping]] can continue until a threshold is met (more bootstraps do not produce a meaningful change). Does the same thing exist for [[Resampling#Jacknife]] and [[Resampling#Jacknife#Leave One Out]] analysis?

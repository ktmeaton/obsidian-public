# Murall et al. (2021) A Small Number of Early Introductions Seeded Widespread Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in QuÃ©bec, Canada

## Summary

> Automatically created by [`seldon`](https://github.com/ktmeaton/seldon).

- Note that PANGO or Nextstrain are viral phylogenetic lineages used for taxonomic purposes, which are distinct from QuÃ©bec transmission lineages, which we define at higher phylogenetic resolution as descendants of a single introduction event, and thus represent a partially observed transmission chain.
- The top eight introductions inferred by ML gave rise to 1544 genomes, or 53% of all sequenced cases (ASR parsimony range: 7â€“12 introductions giving rise to 52â€“75% of all sequenced genomes in the first wave) until June 1st.
- However, the phylogenetically inferred introductions from the USA suggest that these were not as successful as the introductions that happened in early March: the only transmission lineages with > 20 viral genomes of US origin arrived before March 15th (Fig. 2C).
- Similarly, the 72â€“76% inferred introductions that gave rise to small transmission lineages of less than 3 sampled genomes, could each represent transmission lineages of up to 40 cases.
- Independent introductions of PANGO lineages with the derived G allele gave rise to a mean transmission lineage size of 6.6 cases, compared to 3.4 for the ancestral D allele; however, this difference is not statistically significant (Additional file 1: Figure S9).

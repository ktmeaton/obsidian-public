# Meet With Nukhet

[Meeting Link]()

## 2021-09-23

- Ann, acknowledgements rather than co-author
- Building narrative castles about what started and propagated Second Pandemic.
- Issues of molecular clock, central to this paper.
- Molecular clock paradoxical, this is not unique.
- What other organisms are like plague?
- Climatological/ecological parameters, were driving plague development.
- Transmission.
- Vibrio cholera (brackish water), boom-bust, primary host that is non-human.
- Copapod populations
- Strict-species
- Throw confusing signal
- Challenges many things

- 2 things:
	- 1. Flesh out the examples, how misleading this old thinking can be. Deconstruct the old claims that are poorly supported. Correct the old ways of thinking. Styles of thinking, methodological assumptions, examples can be misleading and dangerous, will produce more research, stop the cycle.  Explicit!
	- 2. Talk more about implications, Y. pestis research and greater, inform the way historians think, ecologists thinking about plague. How this can inform? "New avenues of thinking". Offer something, changing older narratives,
	
	- Great potential :)

# Markov Reward

> The rewards are the amount of time that the process spends in a geographic location, which of course is sensitive to sampling bias, but which we might be able to address with the subsampling.

Based on this description I can infer a few things.
1. This process will examine a [[Markov Chain]] of <i>n</i> generations. This chain will be sampling a parameter, in this case [[Geographic Location]] of a particular node.

For [[Phylogeography|phylogeography]], I'm guessing this can be done for either a [[Discrete]] or a [[Continuous]].

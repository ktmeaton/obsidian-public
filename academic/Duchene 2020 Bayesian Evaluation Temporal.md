## Summary

- [[Root to Tip Regression]] is practical, but has several important limitations. 
1. Data points are not independent observations, given that internal branches are traversed multiple times.
2. A strict clock-like behavior is assumed.
- An important concept that is reiterated is [[Measurably Evolving Populations]], which is that sufficient molecular evolution has occurred over the time span of interest.
- [[Date Randomization]] is a powerful way to test for temporal signal, but is a frequentist approach that does not mix well with [[Bayesian]] methods.
- The new model [[Bayesian Evaluation of Temporal Signal|BETS]] compares two competing models:
1.  [[Heterochronous]]: The true sampling date is used.
2.[[Isochronous]]: The sampling dates are all made contemporaneous.
- [[Bayesian Evaluation of Temporal Signal|BETS]] is therefore a test of [[Ultrametric\|ultrametricity]].
- [[Bayes Factor]] is used to evaluate these competing models. In essence, it is the ratio of the [[Marginal Likelihood]] of the models.
- There are numerous ways to estimate the [[Marginal Likelihood]].

## Abstract {.page_break_before}

> This is a placeholder from the original paper proposal. To be re-written once results are finalized.

### Background

The sequencing of ancient pathogen genomes has resulted in vast advancements to our understanding of the second plague pandemic. However, due to limited sample availability, debate remains about the Plague‚Äôs origins, routes of dissemination, genomic diversity, and persistence. Specifically, Scandinavia has a unique history with regards to plague persistence as it is home to the oldest known strain of plague to date and has been ravaged by historic epidemics, only for the plague to have disappeared from this region in the modern era.

### Problem

It is unknown to what extent local plague reservoirs fed the recurring epidemics in Scandinavia as compared to the continual introduction of globally circulated strains. Previously studied historical records primarily derive from large commercial centres such as London, which are contrasted by countries such as Denmark where the archives have retained limited information about the spread of the plague and its impact on society.

### Objectives

To confidently identify and sequence ancient *[[Yersinia pestis]]* from Danish archaeological sites across a wide geographic and temporal range. With the aim of performing genomic analyses to estimate the timing, spread, and evolutionary changes occurring within Danish plague strains as compared to neighboring regions.

### Significance

First, there have been relatively few studies that explore the genetics of plague in Scandinavia across time and geography, particularly in Denmark. Second, this paper contributes to a larger body of epidemiological literature that considers the patterns and mechanisms by which diseases emerge, propagate, and go extinct.

## Introduction  {.page_break_before}

1. When does plague (*[[Yersinia pestis]]*) appear in Denmark?
	- aDNA studies have found that European *[[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]]* is primarily found in Pandemic periods.
	- Examples are the First Pandemic and the Second Pandemic of the Medieval/Early Modern period.
	- However, recent work has highlighted plague is also sporadically present during other periods.
	- Example is the Bronze Age. One of the oldest lineages of plague is found in Sweden, so Northern Europe clearly has a long and interesting history with the disease.
	- It is unknown to what extent our knowledge of the presence/absence of plague is determined by sampling bias.
	- Preferentially targeting pandemic periods and epidemic cemeteries.
2. How is plague in Northern/Western Europe connected to Modern plague. There's the theory of a back migration out of Europe (Netherlands --> Russia). If this is true, then Denmark may also be involved. At 'worst' we expand the relationship of European regions connected to this lineage. At 'best' we capture where that transition from the Black Death clonal lineage to the post-Black Death lineage emerges.

3. Longitudinal study: The possibility to capture how plague affected the same people over time. (Highly regional, with 1 Danish strain?), or 

4. Document the *pla* depletion/restoration events.

## Results  {.page_break_before}

### Sites and Samples

326 individuals were sampled across 6 regions from 14 archaeological sites (Table @tbl:site_summary). The site occupation dates span from the 10th to 18th centuries which encompasses the Viking Age (8th - 10th century), the Medieval Period (11th - 16th century) and the Early Modern Period (16th - 19th century) in Denmark.

### Plague Detection  {.page_break_before}

13 individuals were identified as plague-positive based on a combination of PCR assays, shotgun sequencing, and targeted enrichment for the *[[Yersinia pestis\|Y. pestis]]* whole genome (Tables @tbl:plague_positive_high_coverage and @tbl:plague_positive_low_coverage). Of the 13 individuals, 9 had chromosomal coverage sufficient for phylogenetic analyses.

Overall, plague was detected in 4% (13/325) of all individuals in this study (Table @tbl:site_summary). When excluding plague-negative archaeological sites, this estimate rises to 8.2% (13/159) of individuals. *[[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]]* was observed primarily in the Medieval Period, with no evidence of plague in the Viking Age settlements at Ribe Lindeg√§rden or the Early Modern cemetery at Horsens.

### Dating {.page_break_before}

 I'm relying heavily on the discussion in Boldsen (2009) [[Boldsen 2009 Leprosy Medieval Denmark\|[@boldsen2009LeprosyMedievalDenmark]]], as quoted here:
 
*"The dating of individual skeletons is a fundamental problem in historical studies like this, and even the period of usage of each cemetery raises some serious problems. However, most cemeteries have at least some documentary sources broadly framing them in time. The most intensely studied skeletal samples, Tirup and Westerhus, are really the only exceptions in being dated solely on archaeological evidence (Kieffer-Olsen et al. 1986, Sivƒõn 2005)."*

*"In medieval graves the position of the arms in relation to the rest of the skeleton in the grave is the only feature that systematically indicates dating of the burial within the temporal frame provided by the period of usage of the cemetery. Arm position dating is primarily based on work by Redin (1976) and Kieffer-Olsen (1993). The successive stages of arm position from A (the arms besides the body) over B (hand joint over the lower part of the abdomen and usually found in the pelvis) and C (the forearms over the upper part of the abdomen and the elbows flexed in an approximately right angle) to D (the hands placed on the shoulders, forearms often crossed over the chest) have primarily been described by Kieffer-Olsen (1993) but Jantzen et al. (1994) have slightly modified the transition dates between the various stages."*.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The skeletal and molecular dates of the 9 high coverage *[[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]]* genomes are presented in Table @tbl:tip_dating_summary and Figure @fig:timeline_sites. Almo	st all molecular dates had overlap with the archaeological dates as determined by the site occupation period and burial patterns. The exception to this pattern was individual G371 from the site of Tirup. 

To investigate the dating disparity for G371, we performed 14C radiocarbon dating. The radiocarbon estimate largely agrees with the archaeological dates, with an estimated mean date of 1260 CE (+/- 75 yrs with 1 sigma). Thus there is robust evidence that the individual lived and died sometime between the late 12th and early 14th century

> **Question for Vaughan Grimes.**
> Is the interpretation and visualization of the radiocarbon date appropriate?<br>

However, the associated *[[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]]* genome is dated to the 15th century. While the 2 sigma distribution of the radiocarbon date does extends into the 15th century, there remains a substantial conflict between the date of the host and the associated pathogen.

#### The Black Death {.page_break_before}

Two individuals from Ribe, G25A and G16, cluster with *[[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]]* strains dated to the 14th century. This cluster is thought to be associated with the [[Black Death]] (1346-1353), as the genomes are nearly identical and have been isolated from all across Europe, including France, Spain, England, Germany, and Norway. These genomes mark the first observation of *[[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]]* in Denmark and is congruent with historical records that document the arrival of the Black Death in Ribe in 1349 [[Lenz 2016 Black Death\|[@lenz2016BlackDeath]]]. However, the genome associated with G25A has the lowest sequencing depth, with a mean chromosomal depth of 3.8 molecules per nucleotide.

> **Kat's Note**:<br>
> - G25A has the lowest sequencing depth, with a mean chromosomal depth of 3.8 molecules per nucleotide. This might mean that diagnostic positions for the post-Black Death clade are missing as "false" negatives. This would make it seem earlier/less-derived if those mutations are 'missing'. I will investigate!

Similar to the rest of Western Europe, *[[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]]* appears suddenly in Denmark in the 14th century. No evidence of *[[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]]* was found in Denmark during the preceding centuries, suggesting plague was a relatively new disease for medieval Danish populations. If true, this would imply an immunologically naive population and may have important implications for the study of health and immunity in both past and present Denmark.

Unfortunately, the high degree of genetic similarity means that the branching patterns, and thus dispersal of *[[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]]*, cannot be resolved during this period. Our understanding of the Black Death clade is that of a "Burst" radiation, with limited genetic diversity spreading rapidly over a vast geographic area. This pattern is typical of epidemic spread, and has also been observed at the advent of the Third Plague Pandemic.

#### Ancestors of the Third Pandemic

Interestingly, the *[[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]]* genome associated with individual G25Bx98 (who was found in the same grave as G25A?) is genetically distinct from the earlier strains from Ribe. This isolate falls within a clade of high epidemiological significance, which is the ancestral group giving rise to the [[Third Pandemic]] of plague and the rest of [[Branch 1]].

The phylogenetic position of samples within this clade has been hypothesized to reflect a "backward" migration of plague from Northern Europe into Asia. The *[[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]]* genome retrieved from G25Bx98 tentatively supports this hypothesis, as it falls basal to the more derived strains from The Netherlands and Russia. However, directionality cannot be robustly inferred from four samples alone, particularly given the strong Western European sampling bias of Second Pandemic samples. It will be an important avenue of future research to further develop the relationship between Northern European plague and the only Second Pandemic lineage that is known to persist until the present.

#### Post Black Death

In contrast to the genetic homogeneity observed across Europe during the Black Death period, isolates of plague in the post-Black Death period are easily distinguished. Three genomes collected from three different sites near Horsens derive from independent emergences, despite having temporal overlap. This has also been observed in Germany during this period, as samples collected in relatively close proximity are genetically distinct. A product of this increased genetic diversity means that branching patterns are well resolved in the post-Black Death period. Unfortunately, the geographic origins and dispersal of plague are still challenging to reconstruct, as the number of genomes (N=7) is sparsely sampled relative to the minimum number of countries (N=4) that are implicated.

The pattern of independent emergence is the defining dynamic of plague during this period as all *[[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]]* collected after the Black Death, but prior to the Early Modern Period, are unique lineages. The transition captured here, from little genetic diversity spread across a continent to significant diversity accumulating within a country, may indicate "boom-bust" dynamics [[Strayer 2017 Boom-bust Dynamics Biological\|[@strayer2017BoombustDynamicsBiological]]]. 

> The epidemiological interpretation of this transition requires more thought.

Another defining characteristic of the post-Black Death period is depletion of a key virulence factor,  the *plasminogen activator* (*pla*). Figure @fig:pla_ratio compares the sequencing depth of the *pla* gene to its corresponding plasmid pPCP1 across samples from the Second Pandemic. Two linear trends are observed separating samples with 'normal' gene-to-plasmid ratios from samples that have a 'depleted' gene-to-plasmid ratio. This event was previously observed [Susat 2020 Yersinia Pestis Strains\|[@susat2020YersiniaPestisStrains]]], and found in samples from as early as the 15th century. 

The three Danish genomes from Horsens have temporal overlap with the 15th century and may potentially capture the transition from to a *pla*-depleted state. Unfortunately, the sequencing depth of the pPCP1 plasmid in these samples is insufficient for statistical analysis. The results of a targeted enrichment for the pPCP1 plasmid will be the subject of a forthcoming publication.

#### Early Modern Plague

Following the Medieval Period, the evolutionary dynamic of *[[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]]* changes yet again and a second "Burst" event occurs. Similar to the Black Death "Burst", this event begins with a series of divergences in quick succession, producing highly similar genomes in contemporaneous individuals from Germany, Lithuania, and Poland. Following these divergences, two major lineages emerge. 

The first lineage, termed the Baltic-Alps, has been previously observed in the Baltic countries (Lithuania, Poland, Germany) and the Alps (Switzerland). Three Danish genomes fall within the Baltic-Alps clade, including two samples from coastal Ribe and one sample from inland Viborg. The addition of these samples strengthens the geographic ties of this lineage to the Baltic Region. The epidemiological significance of this localization has been speculated to indicate the formation of a novel plague reservoir within Europe. 

The second lineage that emerges in this period gives rise to later epidemics of plague in Russia, England, and France, including the Great Plague of Marseille (1720-1721). No Danish plague in this study is associated with this lineage. As sampling efforts intensify, it will be interesting to see if these two lineages remain geographically distinct, and to investigate what might be obstructing the flow of plague between them.

## Conclusion

To Be Done post co-author discussion of results.

## Methods {.page_break_before}

### DNA Extraction

Ancient DNA laboratory work was performed in dedicated clean-room facilities at the
McMaster Ancient DNA Centre (Hamilton, ON). A single root of each individual‚Äôs molar was sectioned into two subsamples (50-100 mg) using a circular Dremel. Demineralisation and digestion were performed as previously described [[Schwarz 2009 New Insights Old\|[@schwarz2009NewInsightsOld]]] and DNA extraction was conducted using a specialized protocol designed for ancient DNA [[Dabney 2013 Complete Mitochondrial Genome\|[@dabney2013CompleteMitochondrialGenome]]]. Reagent blanks were introduced as negative controls to monitor DNA contamination in subsequent steps.

### *[[Yersinia pestis]]* PCR screening

An initial plague-screening PCR was performed in duplicate on 1:10 extract dilutions
using a *pla* assay [[Wagner 2014 Yersinia Pestis Plague\|[@wagner2014YersiniaPestisPlague]]]. In brief, the PCR primers used in this study target the 3‚ÄôUTR of the *pla* gene which has reduced sequence similarity in non-*Yersinia* species. The forward primer used is thus far known to be identical to *Yersinia pestis* only. A second round of pla PCR was performed for all extracts that amplified in the initial PCR, using the 1:10 dilution in duplicate and the original concentration in duplicate. In total, 6 PCR replicates were performed for each plague-positive sample.

### Shotgun Sequencing

The extracted DNA of plague-positive individuals was converted into Illumina sequencing libraries 
using a modified protocol [[Meyer 2010 Illumina Sequencing Library\|[@meyer2010IlluminaSequencingLibrary]] [[Kircher 2012 Double Indexing Overcomes\|@kircher2012DoubleIndexingOvercomes]]] and quantified using an Illumina library qPCR assay. Sample libraries were then pooled at equimolar concentrations while negative controls were sequenced at maximum volume input to maximize detection of contaminant organisms. Paired-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 1500 platform (Farncombe Family Digestive Health Research Institute, Hamilton, ON).

### Targeted Sequencing

In-solution enrichment for the pan-genome of *[[Yersinia pestis]]* was performed with a previously designed bait-set [[Wagner 2014 Yersinia Pestis Plague\|[@wagner2014YersiniaPestisPlague]]] and using the myBaits v4 protocol. The following modifications were incorporated to improve recovery of degraded and divergent DNA sequences: 5uL library input, 100ng bait concentration, hybridisation at 60¬∞C, 16‚Äì24h hybridisation capture, and two rounds of enrichment. The enriched libraries were quantified using an Illumina library quantification qPCR assay and pooled at maximum input volume (13uL) due to low concentration. Following pooling, libraries were size-selected on anagarose gel to retain 150‚Äì500bp fragments which corresponds to molecule lengths of approximately 15‚Äì365bp without the adapter sequences. Paired-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 1500 platform at the Farncombe Metagenomics Facility (Hamilton, ON).

### Comparative Genomes

Ancient unassembled genomes from the Second Plague Pandemic were identified using [[NCBImeta]] [[[Eaton 2020 NCBImeta Efficient Comprehensive\|@eaton2020NCBImetaEfficientComprehensive]] and downloaded from the SRA database in [[FASTQ]] format using the [[SRA Toolkit]] [[NCBI 2021 SRA Toolkit\|[@NCBI2021SRAToolkit]]] (Table @tbl:genome_second_pandemic).

*[[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]]* strain [[CO92]] was used as the reference genome for sequence alignment and annotation (Table @tbl:genome_reference). All assembled genomes belonging to phylogenetic branch [[0.ANT3]] were downloaded and used as an outgroup to root the [[Maximum-likelihood\|maximum likelihood]] phylogeny (Table @tbl:genome_outgroup).

### Genomic Alignment

Pre-processing and alignment to the reference genome was performed using the [[nf-core/eager]] pipeline, a reproducible workflow for ancient genome reconstruction [[Yates 2021 Reproducible Portable Efficient\|[@yates2021ReproduciblePortableEfficient]]]. A multiple sequence alignment was constructed using the [[Snippy\|Snippy Core]] module of the [[Snippy]] pipeline [[Snippy 2020\|[@snippy2020]]]. The output alignment was filtered to only include chromosomal variants and to exclude sites that had no more than 30% missing data (ie. no more than 30% of samples having an ambiguous nucleotide) . The value of 30% was selected as the most permissive threshold where the number of shared, parsimony-informative sites (240) was still larger than the number of singleton sites (234) which are observed in a single genome (Figure @fig:aln_missing_data). Furthermore, a 30% threshold was selected as ambiguous nucleotides made up no more than 10% of the alignment (@fig:aln_ambig_sites).

### Phylogeny

Model selection was performed using [[Modelfinder]] which identified the K3Pu+F+I model as the optimal choice based on the [[Bayesian Information Criterion\|Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)]] [[Kalyaanamoorthy 2017 ModelFinder Fast Model\|[@kalyaanamoorthy2017ModelFinderFastModel]]]. A [[Maximum-likelihood\|maximum-likelihood]] phylogeny was then estimated across 10 independent runs of [[IQTREE]] [[Minh 2020 IQTREE New Models\|[@minh2020IQTREENewModels]]]. Branch support was evaluated using 1000 iterations of the [[UFboot\|ultrafast bootstrap approximation]], with a threshold of 95% required for strong support [[Hoang 2018 UFBoot2 Improving Ultrafast\|[@hoang2018UFBoot2ImprovingUltrafast]]].

### Phylodynamics

To evaluate the degree of temporal signal present, a [[Bayesian Evaluation of Temporal Signal]] (BETS) was first performed. Briefly, each candidate model was tested using the correct collection dates of all samples and then compared to the same model with all collection dates assumed to be contemporaneous. Bayes factors (BF) were calculated by comparing the marginal likelihoods of each model, as estimated with a generalized stepping stone (GSS) computation across 100 chains each sampled over 1,000,000 generations.

The BETS analysis revealed decisive support for temporal signal (dates vs. no dates) using both the strict clock (SC) and the uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock (UCLN) (Table @tbl:bets_summary). A comparison of the strict vs. relaxed clocks using collection date produced decisive support for the relaxed clock. Therefore, a time-scaled phylogeny with tip-dating was estimated using a relaxed clock and diffuse normal priors centered around the mean collection date.

## Summary

- The [[Second Pandemic]] [[plague]] [[Foci|reservoir]] existed outside [[Western Europe]]. Recirculation within [[Europe]] followed commercial and military routes.
- Decay of the **[[pla]]** gene did not cause the end of the [[Second Pandemic]]. The varied presence of this event throughout the [[Second Pandemic]] instead reflects adaptation to new hosts and/or alternate disease forms such as [[Septicemic]] [[Plague]].
- [[Sampling Bias]] is a problem for [[Phylogeography|phylogeographic inference]] of the [[Second Pandemic]].


## Notes

### [[Second Pandemic]] [[Geographic Origin]]
- [[Bramanti 2021 Assessing Origins European \|Bramanti et al. (2021)]] investigate whether the [[Second Pandemic]] was sourced by [[Western Europe]] [[Foci|reservoirs]], or Non-Western Europe reservoirs.
- [[Western Europe]] Reservoir Support: 
	- [[Spyrou 2016 Historical Pestis Genomes|Spyrou et al. (2016)]]
	- [[Spyrou 2019 Phylogeography Second Plague\|Spyrou et al. (2019)]] 
	- [[Susat 2020 Yersinia Pestis Strains\|Susat et al. (2020)]] 
	- [[Seguin-Orlando 2021 No Particular Genomic\|Seguin Orlando et al. (2021)]].
- Non-Western Europe Reservoir Support: 
	- [[Namouchi 2018 Integrative Approach Using\|Namouchi et al. (2018)]]
	- [[Guellil 2020 Genomic Historical Synthesis|Guellil et al. (2020)]]
	- [[Morozova 2020 New Ancient Eastern\|Morozova et al. (2020)]]
	- [[Bramanti 2016 A Disease Which Changed\|Bramanti et al. (2016)]]
	- [[Schmid 2015 Climate-Driven Introduction Black\|Schmid et al. (2015)]]
- Mixed Model (my own notes):
	- [[Seifert 2016 Genotyping Yersinia Pestis\|Seifert et al. (2016)]]
- Constructing an updated [[Phylogenetic\|phylogeny]] confirms that [[Yersinia pestis\|Y. pestis]] associated with the [[Black Death]] are [[Clonal\|clonal]] in nature.
- [[Phylogeography]] is performed with an unconventional approach: [[Stochastic Source Mapping]] using an [[ARD Model]], run for 10,000 generations of [[MCMC]] sampled every 100 generations.
- An [[Alps\|Alpine]] cluster is composed of sites LBG, STN, BRA, LAR and SPN, which is thought to be explained by the Thirty Years War (1618-1648). I think this is a circular argument, as BRA couldn't be [[Radiocarbon]] dated, and archaeological context was used to date it to exactly the [[Thirty Years War]] (1618-1648). Also the STN samples are more likely to derive from the 1500s.

### [[Attenuation]] of [[Virulence]]
- [[Bramanti 2021 Assessing Origins European \|Bramanti et al. (2021)]] tests for the [[attentuation]] of [[Virulence\|virulence]] at the end of the [[Second Pandemic]].
- A 49kbp deletion appears in the most recent clade of the [[Second Pandemic]], starting with the [[BED]] samples. Intriguingly, it was both present and absent in the site of [[Rostov]]. The deletion also occurs in the [[First Pandemic]] clade [[0.ANT4]].
- [[Susat 2020 Yersinia Pestis Strains\|Susat et al. (2020)]] proposed that a depletion of the [[pla]] gene caused the disappearance of the [[Second Pandemic]] in the [[18th Century]]. The ratio of [[pla]] during and post the [[Black Death]] is different compared to the [[LNBA]] and [[First Pandemic]].
- They suggest that this was never observed in [[Modern\|modern]] [[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]], but I would need more detail on the following statement to understand (and believe):
> We have also checked randomly selected modern Y. pestis genomes in different lineages, and their depth of pla and pPCP1 are quite consistent, indicating no other pla-loss in modern plagues. 
- In general, there is a [[pla]] depletion at the end of the [[Second Pandemic]], although there are notable exceptions. [[Rostov]] ([[Rostov2033]]) has no depletion and [[CHE1]] has only slight decay.
- Rather than causing the end of the [[Second Pandemic]], [[Bramanti 2021 Assessing Origins European \|Bramanti et al. (2021)]] proposes this reflects different transmission mechanisms such as [[Bubonic]] and [Pneumonic]] plague (requires [[pla]]) versus [[Septicemic]] plague does not.

I like the use of pie charts to visualize uncertainty at internal nodes in Figure S1.

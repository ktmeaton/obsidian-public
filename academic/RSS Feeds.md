# [[RSS Feeds]]

## Summary

[[RSS Feeds]] is an [[Obsidian]] plugin that lets you browse RSS feeds.

Search for `rss` in the source code of the website.
If a site is hosted on **Tumblr**, add `/rss` to the end of the URL. Like this: `https://example.tumblr.com/rss`
If a site is hosted on **Blogger**, add `feeds/posts/default` to the end of the URL. Like this: `example.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default`
If a publication is hosted on **Medium**, add `/feed/` before the publication's name. So `medium.com/example-site` becomes `medium.com/feed/example-site`
**YouTube** channel pages double as RSS feeds. Simply copy and paste the URL for the channel into your RSS reader. You can also find an OPML file for all of your subscriptions [here](https://www.youtube.com/subscription_manager).

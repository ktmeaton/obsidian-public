- It is made available under a preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in  The copyright holder for this this version posted October 30, 2022.
- Importantly,  BA.5 breakthrough infection yields higher plasma NT50 against BA.5 sublineages, including  BQ.1.1; however, plasma from BA.5 breakthrough infection neutralize poorly against XBB,  CH.1.1, BQ.1.1.10 and BA.4.6.3, suggesting that the NTD mutations they carry are extremely  120  effective at evading NAbs elicited by BA.5 breakthrough infection (Fig. 2f).
- We constructed  the VSV-based spike-pseudotyped virus of Omicron BA.2, BA.2.75, and BA.4/5 sublineages  carrying those convergent mutations and examined the neutralizing activities of therapeutic  neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against them (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 1a) 26-28.
- Overall, these convergent  variants all demonstrate sufficient ACE2-binding efficiency, at least higher than that of D614G,  including the most antibody-evasive XBB, BQ.1.1, and CH.1.1 (Fig. 2b and Extended Data  95  Fig. 1b).
- E3 antibodies seem not significantly affected by any of the constructed mutants, as  expected (Extended Data Fig. 7c), but they generally exhibit very low neutralization (Extended  Data Fig. 7d).

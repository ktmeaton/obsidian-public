# Prepare A Presentation for Lab Meeting

## The Significance of Plague

- Plague, as a disease, has a long history with humans.
- Earliest evidence is from the [[LNBA|LNBA]], there are three historically known pandemics, with the latest finishing in the 20th century.
- These pandemics had extreme effects on society, ex. Black Death extreme mortality, continuing every 5-10 years for 600 years.
- Our modern world has transformed drastically in just 2 years of our covid experience. Imagine, way worse mortality, and another 600 years.
- tldr; 

## The Uncertainty

- Despite hundreds of years of research, there's a lot we don't know about plague.
- It's extremely hard to build epidemiological models to explain and predict why human outbreaks happen.
- A big part of that is because of most plague's lifecycle is invisible.
- *[[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]]*/plague is a disease of great significance, causing multiple pandemics in the past.
- As a zoonoses of rodents, a lot of plague's history is invisible to us.

4. There's a lot we don't know about these pandemics, (where, when, how)

## Modeling Uncertainty

- Molecular Clock (wagner)
- Phylogeography (Brazil?)
- 

- There is little consensus on ... populations of *[[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]]*.
- There are two major systems:
	- Relative Phylogenetic Position (to the Big Bang Polytomy)
	- Metabolic Biovars (ferment and reduce)
	-

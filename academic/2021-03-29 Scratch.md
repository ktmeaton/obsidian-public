I've discovered I'll need to do COVID awareness training before I come to campus.

- #:white_large_square:/:steam_locomotive: | COVID-19 Awareness training.

I'll read and take notes on [[Perry 2021 Did Black Death|David Perry's]] interview of [[Monica Green]].

- #:white_large_square:/:steam_locomotive: | Takes note on Monica Green's interview.
- #:white_large_square:/:steam_locomotive: | Read Monica Green's 2020 article.

Ugh it's time to do my taxes.

I'll need to schedule a committee meeting before [[2021-04-30]].

- #:white_large_square:/:clipboard: | [[2021-04-05]] | Send email about committee meeting.

### Freezer Defrost

1. Please label your boxes well with dates, names, project descriptions, contents, etc.
3. Please go through and throw out dilutions relatively soon after you've used them.
4. If you're not going to use your non-enriched fractions (NEF) for a particular project, toss them.
5. Combine small projects together into the same box.
6. Don't use tip boxes as PCR tube storage.
7. If you're going to use tipÂ boxes as PCR tube storage.
8. Consider using 0.6 mL tubes where possible for long-term storage.

>Hi Tyler and Mel,

I think any NEF or dilutions of mine you find can be thrown out. It's been long enough since I've done labwork that the dilutions and NEF are probably no good anymore.

### [[Plague Denmark]], [[pla]] gene

Some interesting ratios:

| Sample | pPCP1 | 
| ------ | ----- |

> My libraries are such low complexity that I don't think resequencing is going to generate anything new :( Also the lack of coverage for the gap-bridging region might be a result in itself? Especially since those samples are 30X+ depth. My instinct would be that's enough to robustly detect structural variants. However, I don't know the analysis well enough for this part, so I'd default to whatever plan you suggest!

## [[Plague Phylodynamics and Phylogeography]]

I'm going to start work on the [[Sampling Bias Experiment]].

  abstract = {The emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7, first detected in the United Kingdom, has become a global public health concern because of its increased transmissibility. Over 2,500 COVID-19 cases associated with this variant have been detected in the United States (US) since December 2020, but the extent of establishment is relatively unknown. Using travel, genomic, and diagnostic data, we highlight that the primary ports of entry for B.1.1.7 in the US were in New York, California, and Florida. Furthermore, we found evidence for many independent B.1.1.7 establishments starting in early December 2020, followed by interstate spread by the end of the month. Finally, we project that B.1.1.7 will be the dominant lineage in many states by mid- to late March. Thus, genomic surveillance for B.1.1.7 and other variants urgently needs to be enhanced to better inform the public health response.},

  abstract = {Background Many countries have attempted to mitigate and control COVID-19 through non-pharmaceutical interventions, particularly with the aim of reducing population movement and contact. However, it remains unclear how the different control strategies impacted the local phylodynamics of the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus. Aim We aimed to assess the duration of chains of virus transmission within individual countries and the extent to which countries exported viruses to their geographical neighbours. Methods We analysed complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes to infer the relative frequencies of virus importation and exportation, as well as virus transmission dynamics, in countries of northern Europe. We examined virus evolution and phylodynamics in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results The Nordic countries differed markedly in the invasiveness of control strategies, which we found reflected in transmission chain dynamics. For example, Sweden, which compared with the other Nordic countries relied more on recommendation-based rather than legislation-based mitigation interventions, had transmission chains that were more numerous and tended to have more cases. This trend increased over the first 8 months of 2020. Together with Denmark, Sweden was a net exporter of SARS-CoV-2. Norway and Finland implemented legislation-based interventions; their transmission chain dynamics were in stark contrast to their neighbouring country Sweden. Conclusion Sweden constituted an epidemiological and evolutionary refugium that enabled the virus to maintain active transmission and spread to other geographical locations. Our analysis reveals the utility of genomic surveillance where monitoring of active transmission chains is a key metric.},

  abstract = {Phylogenetics has played a pivotal role in the genomic epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, such as tracking the emergence and global spread of variants and scientific communication. However, the rapid accumulation of genomic data from around the world—with over two million genomes currently available in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data database—is testing the limits of standard phylogenetic methods. Here, we describe a new approach to rapidly analyze and visualize large numbers of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Using Python, genomes are filtered for problematic sites, incomplete coverage, and excessive divergence from a strict molecular clock. All differences from the reference genome, including indels, are extracted using minimap2 and compactly stored as a set of features for each genome. For each Pango lineage (https://cov-lineages.org), we collapse genomes with identical features into ‘variants’, generate 100 bootstrap samples of the feature set union to generate weights, and compute the symmetric differences between the weighted feature sets for every pair of variants. The resulting distance matrices are used to generate neighbor-joining trees in RapidNJ that are converted into a majority-rule consensus tree for each lineage. Branches with support values below 50\,per cent or mean lengths below 0.5 differences are collapsed, and tip labels on affected branches are mapped to internal nodes as directly sampled ancestral variants. Currently, we process about 2 million genomes in approximately 9\,h on 52 cores. The resulting trees are visualized using the JavaScript framework D3.js as ‘beadplots’, in which variants are represented by horizontal line segments, annotated with beads representing samples by collection date. Variants are linked by vertical edges to represent branches in the consensus tree. These visualizations are published at https://filogeneti.ca/CoVizu.

  abstract = {The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiopathogenic agent of COVID-19, a condition that has led to a formally recognized pandemic by March 2020 (World Health Organization –WHO). The SARS-CoV-2 genome is constituted of 29,903 base pairs, that code for four structural proteins (N, M, S, and E) and more than 20 non-structural proteins. Mutations in any of these regions, especially in those that encode for the structural proteins, have allowed the identification of diverse lineages around the world, some of them named as Variants of Concern (VOC) and Variants of Interest (VOI), according to the WHO and CDC. In this study, by using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology, we sequenced the SARS-CoV-2 genome of 422 samples from Colombian residents, all of them collected between April 2020 and January 2021. We obtained genetic information from 386 samples, leading us to the identification of 14 new lineages circulating in Colombia, 13 of which were identified for the first time in South America. GH was the predominant GISAID clade in our sample. Most mutations were either missense (53.6\%) or synonymous mutations (37.4\%), and most genetic changes were located in the ORF1ab gene (63.9\%), followed by the S gene (12.9\%). In the latter, we identified mutations E484K, L18F, and D614G. Recent evidence suggests that these mutations concede important particularities to the virus, compromising host immunity, the diagnostic test performance, and the effectiveness of some vaccines. Some important lineages containing these mutations are the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma (WHO Label). Further genomic surveillance is important for the understanding of emerging genomic variants and their correlation with disease severity.},

  abstract = {The unprecedented SARS-CoV-2 global sequencing effort has suffered from an analytical bottleneck. Many existing methods for phylogenetic analysis are designed for sparse, static datasets and are too computationally expensive to apply to densely sampled, rapidly expanding datasets when results are needed immediately to inform public health action. For example, public health is often concerned with identifying clusters of closely related samples, but the sheer scale of the data prevents manual inspection and the current computational models are often too expensive in time and resources. Even when results are available, intuitive data exploration tools are of critical importance to effective public health interpretation and action. To help address this need, we present a phylogenetic summary statistic which quickly and efficiently identifies newly introduced strains in a region, resulting clusters of infected individuals, and their putative geographic origins. We show that this approach performs well on simulated data and is congruent with a more sophisticated analysis performed during the pandemic. We also introduce Cluster Tracker (https://clustertracker.gi.ucsc.edu/), a novel interactive web-based tool to facilitate effective and intuitive SARS-CoV-2 geographic data exploration and visualization. Cluster-Tracker is updated daily and automatically identifies and highlights groups of closely related SARS-CoV-2 infections resulting from inter-regional transmission across the United States, streamlining public health tracking of local viral diversity and emerging infection clusters. The combination of these open-source tools will empower detailed investigations of the geographic origins and spread of SARS-CoV-2 and other densely-sampled pathogens.},

  abstract = {Tracking the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 is critical to inform public health interventions. Phylodynamic analyses have quantified SARS-CoV-2 migration on global and local scales1–5, yet they have not been applied to determine transmission dynamics in Canada. We quantified SARS-CoV-2 migration into, within, and out of Canada in the context of COVID-19 travel restrictions. To minimize sampling bias, global sequences were subsampled with probabilities corrected for their countries’ monthly contribution to global new diagnoses. A time-scaled maximum likelihood tree was used to estimate most likely ancestral geographic locations (country or Canadian province), enabling identification of sublineages, defined as introduction events into Canada resulting in domestic transmission. Of 402 Canadian sublineages identified, the majority likely originated from the USA (54\%), followed by Russia (7\%), India (6\%), Italy (6\%), and the UK (5\%). International introductions were mostly into Ontario (39\%) and Quebec (38\%). Among Pango lineages6, B.1 was imported at least 191 separate times from 11 different countries. Introduction rates peaked in late March then diminished but were not eliminated following national interventions including restrictions on non-essential travel. We further identified 1,380 singleton importations, international importations that did not result in further sampled transmission, whereby representation of lineages and location were comparable to sublineages. Although proportion of international transmission decreased over time, this coincided with exponential growth of within-province transmission – in fact, total number of sampled transmission events from international or interprovincial sources increased from winter 2020 into spring 2020 in many provinces. Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia acted as sources of transmission more than recipients, within the caveat of higher sequence representation. We present strong evidence that international introductions and interprovincial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 contributed to the Canadian COVID-19 burden throughout 2020, despite initial reductions mediated by travel restrictions in 2020. More stringent border controls and quarantine measures may have curtailed introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Canada and may still be warranted. Significance Statement By analyzing SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Canada in the context of the global pandemic, we illuminate the extent to which the COVID-19 burden in Canada was perpetuated by ongoing international importations and interprovincial transmission throughout 2020. Although travel restrictions enacted in March 2020 reduced the importation rate and proportion of transmission from abroad across all Canadian provinces, SARS-CoV-2 introductions from the USA, India, Russia, and other nations were detectable through the summer and fall of 2020.},

Major pandemics and epidemics such as plague, cholera, flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have already afflicted humanity. The world is now facing the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Many infectious diseases leading to pandemics are caused by zoonotic pathogens that were transmitted to humans due to increased contacts with animals through breeding, hunting and global trade activities. The understanding of the mechanisms of transmission of pathogens to humans allowed the establishment of methods to prevent and control infections. During centuries, implementation of public health measures such as isolation, quarantine and border control helped to contain the spread of infectious diseases and maintain the structure of the society. In the absence of pharmaceutical interventions, these containment methods have still been used nowadays to control COVID-19 pandemic. Global surveillance programs of water-borne pathogens, vector-borne diseases and zoonotic spillovers at the animal-human interface are of prime importance to rapidly detect the emergence of infectious threats. Novel technologies for rapid diagnostic testing, contact tracing, drug repurposing, biomarkers of disease severity as well as new platforms for the development and production of vaccines are needed for an effective response in case of pandemics.},

  abstract = {Summary Comparative analysis of bacterial plasmids from whole genome sequence (WGS) data generated from short read sequencing is challenging. This is due to the difficulty in identifying contigs harbouring plasmid sequence data, and further difficulty in assembling such contigs into a full plasmid. As such, few software programs and bioinformatics pipelines exist to perform comprehensive comparative analyses of plasmids within and amongst sequenced isolates. To address this gap, we have developed Plasmid Profiler, a pipeline to perform comparative plasmid content analysis without the need for de novo assembly. The pipeline is designed to rapidly identify plasmid sequences by mapping reads to a plasmid reference sequence database. Predicted plasmid sequences are then annotated with their incompatibility group, if known. The pipeline allows users to query plasmids for genes or regions of interest and visualize results as an interactive heat map. Availability and Implementation Plasmid Profiler is freely available software released under the Apache 2.0 open source software license.

  abstract = {Background: The Sequence Read Archive (SRA) is the largest public repository of sequencing data from the next generation of sequencing platforms including Illumina (Genome Analyzer, HiSeq, MiSeq, .etc), Roche 454 GS System, Applied Biosystems SOLiD System, Helicos Heliscope, PacBio RS, and others. Results: SRAdb is an attempt to make queries of the metadata associated with SRA submission, study, sample, experiment and run more robust and precise, and make access to sequencing data in the SRA easier. We have parsed all the SRA metadata into a SQLite database that is routinely updated and can be easily distributed. The SRAdb R/Bioconductor package then utilizes this SQLite database for querying and accessing metadata. Full text search functionality makes querying metadata very flexible and powerful. Fastq files associated with query results can be downloaded easily for local analysis. The package also includes an interface from R to a popular genome browser, the Integrated Genomics Viewer. Conclusions: SRAdb Bioconductor package provides a convenient and integrated framework to query and access SRA metadata quickly and powerfully from within R.},

  {"id":"aanensen2016WholeGenomeSequencingRoutine","abstract":"The implementation of routine whole-genome sequencing (WGS) promises to transform our ability to monitor the emergence and spread of bacterial pathogens. Here we combined WGS data from 308 invasive Staphylococcus aureus isolates corresponding to a pan-European population snapshot, with epidemiological and resistance data. Geospatial visualization of the data is made possible by a generic software tool designed for public health purposes that is available at the project URL (http://www.microreact.org/project/EkUvg9uY?tt=rc). Our analysis demonstrates that high-risk clones can be identified on the basis of population level properties such as clonal relatedness, abundance, and spatial structuring and by inferring virulence and resistance properties on the basis of gene content. We also show that in silico predictions of antibiotic resistance profiles are at least as reliable as phenotypic testing. We argue that this work provides a comprehensive road map illustrating the three vital components for future molecular epidemiological surveillance: (i) large-scale structured surveys, (ii) WGS, and (iii) community-oriented database infrastructure and analysis tools.\nIMPORTANCE The spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a public health emergency of global concern, threatening medical intervention at every level of health care delivery. Several recent studies have demonstrated the promise of routine whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of bacterial pathogens for epidemiological surveillance, outbreak detection, and infection control. However, as this technology becomes more widely adopted, the key challenges of generating representative national and international data sets and the development of bioinformatic tools to manage and interpret the data become increasingly pertinent. This study provides a road map for the integration of WGS data into routine pathogen surveillance. We emphasize the importance of large-scale routine surveys to provide the population context for more targeted or localized investigation and the development of open-access bioinformatic tools to provide the means to combine and compare independently generated data with publicly available data sets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Aanensen","given":"David M."},{"family":"Feil","given":"Edward J."},{"family":"Holden","given":"Matthew T.

  {"id":"achtman1999YersiniaPestisCause","abstract":"Plague, one of the most devastating diseases of human history, is caused by Yersinia pestis. In this study, we analyzed the population genetic structure of Y. pestis and the two other pathogenic Yersinia species, Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica. Fragments of five housekeeping genes and a gene involved in the synthesis of lipopolysaccharide were sequenced from 36 strains representing the global diversity of Y. pestis and from 12-13 strains from each of the other species. No sequence diversity was found in any Y. pestis gene, and these alleles were identical or nearly identical to alleles from Y. pseudotuberculosis. Thus, Y. pestis is a clone that evolved from Y. pseudotuberculosis 1,500-20,000 years ago, shortly before the first known pandemics of human plague. Three biovars (Antiqua, Medievalis, and Orientalis) have been distinguished by microbiologists within the Y. pestis clone. These biovars form distinct branches of a phylogenetic tree based on restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the locations of the IS100 insertion element. These data are consistent with previous inferences that Antiqua caused a plague pandemic in the sixth century, Medievalis caused the Black Death and subsequent epidemics during the second pandemic wave, and Orientalis caused the current plague pandemic.","author":[{"family":"Achtman","given":"M."},{"family":"Zurth","given":"K."},{"family":"Morelli","given":"G."},{"family":"Torrea","given":"G."},{"family":"Guiyoule","given":"A."},{"family":"Carniel","given":"E."}],"citation-key":"achtman1999YersiniaPestisCause","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","container-title-short":"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.96.24.14043","ISSN":"0027-8424","issue":"24","issued":{"date-parts":[[1999,11,23]]},"language":"eng","page":"14043-14048","PMCID":"PMC24187","PMID":"10570195","source":"PubMed","title":"Yersinia pestis, the cause of plague, is a recently emerged clone of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis","type":"article-journal","volume":"96"},

We generated a comprehensive collection of datasets, enriched in metadata, and organized this information into data frames ready to be integrated into microbiome research projects and advanced post-processing analysis, such as data science applications (e.g. machine learning). Furthermore, we have created a data retrieval and curation framework built on three different stages to maximize the retrieval of datasets and metadata associated with them.

  {"id":"andradesvaltuena2017StoneAgePlague","abstract":"Yersinia pestis, the etiologic agent of plague, is a bacterium associated with wild rodents and their fleas. Historically it was responsible for three pandemics: the Plague of Justinian in the 6th century AD, which persisted until the 8th century [1]; the renowned Black Death of the 14th century [2, 3], with recurrent outbreaks until the 18th century [4]; and the most recent 19th century pandemic, in which Y. pestis spread worldwide [5] and became endemic in several regions [6]. The discovery of molecular signatures of Y. pestis in prehistoric Eurasian individuals and two genomes from Southern Siberia suggest that Y. pestis caused some form of disease in humans prior to the first historically documented pandemic [7]. Here, we present six new European Y. pestis genomes spanning the Late Neolithic to the Bronze Age (LNBA; 4,800 to 3,700 calibrated years before present). This time period is characterized by major transformative cultural and social changes that led to cross-European networks of contact and exchange [8, 9]. We show that all known LNBA strains form a single putatively extinct clade in the Y. pestis phylogeny. Interpreting our data within the context of recent ancient human genomic evidence that suggests an increase in human mobility during the LNBA, we propose a possible scenario for the early spread of Y. pestis: the pathogen may have entered Europe from Central Eurasia following an expansion of people from the steppe, persisted within Europe until the mid-Bronze Age, and moved back toward Central Eurasia in parallel with human populations.","author":[{"family":"Andrades Valtueña","given":"Aida"},{"family":"Mittnik","given":"Alissa"},{"family":"Key","given":"Felix M."},{"family":"Haak","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Allmäe","given":"Raili"},{"family":"Belinskij","given":"Andrej"},{"family":"Daubaras","given":"Mantas"},{"family":"Feldman","given":"Michal"},{"family":"Jankauskas","given":"Rimantas"},{"family":"Janković","given":"Ivor"},{"family":"Massy","given":"Ken"},{"family":"Novak","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Pfrengle","given":"Saskia"},{"family":"Reinhold","given":"Sabine"},{"family":"Šlaus","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Spyrou","given":"Maria A."},{"family":"Szécsényi-Nagy","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Tõrv","given":"Mari"},{"family":"Hansen","given":"Svend"},{"family":"Bos","given":"Kirsten I."},{"family":"Stockhammer","given":"Philipp W."},{"family":"Herbig","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Krause","given":"Johannes"}],"citation-key":"andradesvaltuena2017StoneAgePlague","container-title":"Current Biology","container-title-short":"Curr.

These and other metaphors are at the core of the three essays Moretti published in the New Left Review in 2003 and 2004 under the common heading “Graphs, Maps, Trees: Abstract Models for Literary History.” I argue that although Moretti draws his models from scientific disciplines (graphs from quantitative history, maps from geography, and trees from evolutionary theory), he actually uses them to support theories that lack proper verification, incurring the danger of bending reality to theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Ascari","given":"Maurizio"}],"citation-key":"ascari2014DangersDistantReading","container-title":"Genre: Forms of Discourse and Culture","container-title-short":"Genre: Forms of Discourse and Culture","DOI":"10.1215/00166928-2392348","ISSN":"0016-6928","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"page":"1-19","publisher":"Duke University Press","source":"Scholars Portal Journals","title":"The Dangers of Distant Reading: Reassessing Moretti's Approach to Literary Genres","title-short":"The Dangers of Distant Reading","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.scholarsportal.info/detailsundefined","volume":"47"},

  {"id":"baele2013AccurateModelSelection","abstract":"Recent implementations of path sampling (PS) and stepping-stone sampling (SS) have been shown to outperform the harmonic mean estimator (HME) and a posterior simulation-based analog of Akaike’s information criterion through Markov chain Monte Carlo (AICM), in Bayesian model selection of demographic and molecular clock models. Almost simultaneously, a Bayesian model averaging approach was developed that avoids conditioning on a single model but averages over a set of relaxed clock models. This approach returns estimates of the posterior probability of each clock model through which one can estimate the Bayes factor in favor of the maximum a posteriori (MAP) clock model; however, this Bayes factor estimate may suffer when the posterior probability of the MAP model approaches 1. Here, we compare these two recent developments with the HME, stabilized/smoothed HME (sHME), and AICM, using both synthetic and empirical data. Our comparison shows reassuringly that MAP identification and its Bayes factor provide similar performance to PS and SS and that these approaches considerably outperform HME, sHME, and AICM in selecting the correct underlying clock model. We also illustrate the importance of using proper priors on a large set of empirical data sets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Baele","given":"Guy"},{"family":"Li","given":"Wai Lok Sibon"},{"family":"Drummond","given":"Alexei J."},{"family":"Suchard","given":"Marc A."},{"family":"Lemey","given":"Philippe"}],"citation-key":"baele2013AccurateModelSelection","container-title":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Mol Biol Evol","DOI":"10.1093/molbev/mss243","ISSN":"0737-4038","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,2]]},"page":"239-243","PMCID":"PMC3548314","PMID":"23090976","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Accurate model selection of relaxed molecular clocks in Bayesian phylogenetics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3548314/","volume":"30"},

Several epidemics of plague have occurred in the territory of Georgia. In 1933, the Transcaucasian Anti-Plague Center was established in Tbilisi. There are two natural foci of plague in the territory of Georgia: plain–foothill and high mountainous. The Georgian Anti-Plague Station carried out active surveillance on natural foci. In the plain–foothill focus, plague epizootics were established in 1966 and in 1968–1971. In the high-mountainous focus, plague epizootics were established in 1979–1983 and in 1992–1997. A total of 122 strains of Yersinia pestis were isolated in Georgia – 83 in the plain–foothill focus and 39 in the highmountainous focus; 46 strains are kept at the National Center for Disease Control and Public Health’s Microbial Library. Although no new isolates were obtained in recent years, the plague foci in Georgia are so close to populated areas that they must be under permanent control to be able to respond rapidly to emergencies.","author":[{"family":"Bakanidze","given":"Lela"},{"family":"Imnadze","given":"Paata"},{"family":"Chubinidze","given":"Svetlana"},{"family":"Tsertsvadze","given":"Nikoloz"},{"family":"Mgeladze","given":"Gela"},{"family":"Shalutashvili","given":"Irakli"},{"family":"Tsanava","given":"Shota"},{"family":"Shavishvili","given":"Merab"},{"family":"Manvelyan","given":"Julietta"},{"family":"Ninashvili","given":"Nana"},{"family":"Katsitadze","given":"Guram"}],"citation-key":"bakanidze2010SurveillancePlagueNatural","collection-title":"NATO Science for Peace and Security Series A: Chemistry and Biology","container-title":"Emerging and Endemic Pathogens","DOI":"10.1007/978-90-481-9637-1_3","editor":[{"family":"O'Connell","given":"Kevin P."},{"family":"Skowronski","given":"Evan W."},{"family":"Sulakvelidze","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Bakanidze","given":"Lela"}],"event-place":"Dordrecht","ISBN":"978-90-481-9637-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"language":"en","page":"21-28","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher-place":"Dordrecht","source":"Springer Link","title":"Surveillance on Plague in Natural Foci in Georgia","type":"paper-conference"},
  {"id":"barbieri2020YersiniaPestisNatural","abstract":"The Gram-negative bacterium Yersinia pestis is responsible for deadly plague, a zoonotic disease established in stable foci in the Americas, Africa, and Eurasia. Its persistence in the environment relies on the subtle balance between Y. pestis-contaminated soils, burrowing and nonburrowing mammals exhibiting variable degrees of plague susceptibility, and their associated fleas. Transmission from one host to another relies mainly on infected flea bites, inducing typical painful, enlarged lymph nodes referred to as buboes, followed by septicemic dissemination of the pathogen. In contrast, droplet inhalation after close contact with infected mammals induces primary pneumonic plague. Finally, the rarely reported consumption of contaminated raw meat causes pharyngeal and gastrointestinal plague. Point-of-care diagnosis, early antibiotic treatment, and confinement measures contribute to outbreak control despite residual mortality. Mandatory primary prevention relies on the active surveillance of established plague foci and ectoparasite control. Plague is acknowledged to have infected human populations for at least 5,000 years in Eurasia. Y. pestis genomes recovered from affected archaeological sites have suggested clonal evolution from a common ancestor shared with the closely related enteric pathogen Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and have indicated that ymt gene acquisition during the Bronze Age conferred Y. pestis with ectoparasite transmissibility while maintaining its enteric transmissibility. Three historic pandemics, starting in 541 AD and continuing until today, have been described. At present, the third pandemic has become largely quiescent, with hundreds of human cases being reported mainly in a few impoverished African countries, where zoonotic plague is mostly transmitted to people by rodent-associated flea bites.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Barbieri","given":"R."},{"family":"Signoli","given":"M."},{"family":"Chevé","given":"D."},{"family":"Costedoat","given":"C."},{"family":"Tzortzis","given":"S."},{"family":"Aboudharam","given":"G."},{"family":"Raoult","given":"D."},{"family":"Drancourt","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"barbieri2020YersiniaPestisNatural","container-title":"Clinical Microbiology Reviews","DOI":"10.1128/CMR.00044-19","ISSN":"0893-8512, 1098-6618","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,16]]},"language":"en","PMID":"33298527","publisher":"American Society for Microbiology Journals","section":"Review","source":"cmr.asm.org","title":"Yersinia pestis: the Natural History of Plague","title-short":"Yersinia pestis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://cmr.asm.org/content/34/1/e00044-19","volume":"34"},

  {"id":"benedictowEpidemiologyPlagueProblems","abstract":"This article addresses the recent use of mathematical epidemiological SIR or SEIR models in plague research. This use of S(E)IR models is highly problematic, but the problems are not presented and considered. Serious problems show in that such models are used to \"prove\" that historical plague was a (1) Filoviridae disease and (2) a bacterial disease caused by Yersinia pestis which was transmitted by human fleas and lice. (3) They also support early-phase transmission (by fleas). They purportedly consistently disprove (4) the conventional view that plague is/was a rat-and-rat-flea-borne disease. For these reasons, the focus is on methodological problems and on empirical testing by modern medical, entomological, and historical epidemiological data. An important or predominant vectorial role in plague epidemics for human fleas and lice requires that several necessary conditions are satisfied, which are generally not considered by advocates of the human ectoparasite hypothesis of plague transmission: (1) the prevalence and levels of human plague bacteraemia (human plague cases as sources of infection of feeding human ectoparasites); (2) the general size of blood meals ingested by human fleas and lice; (3) the consequent number of ingested plague bacteria; (4) the lethal dose of bacteria for 50% of a normal sample of infected human beings, LD50; and (5) efficient mechanism of transmission by lice and by fleas. The factual answers to these crucial questions can be ascertained and shown to invalidate the human ectoparasite hypothesis. The view of the standard works on plague has been corroborated, that bubonic plague, historical and modern, is/was a rat-and-rat-flea-borne disease caused by Yersinia pestis. These conclusions are concordant with and corroborate recent studies which, by laboratory experiments, invalidated the early-transmission hypothesis as a mechanism of transmission of LDs to humans in plague epidemics and removed this solution to the problem of transmission by human fleas.","author":[{"family":"Benedictow","given":"Ole J."}],"citation-key":"benedictowEpidemiologyPlagueProblems","container-title":"Canadian Journal of Infectious Diseases and Medical Microbiology","DOI":"10.1155/2019/1542024","title":"Epidemiology of Plague: Problems with the Use of Mathematical Epidemiological Models in Plague Research and the Question of Transmission by Human Fleas and Lice","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.hindawi.com/journals/cjidmm/2019/1542024/?utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound"},

Among such pathogens, the genus Mycobacterium is well represented by M. bovis, the etiological agent of bovine tuberculosis, M. avium ssp. paratuberculosis (Map) the etiological agent of Johne disease, M. avium ssp. avium (Maa) and in a few common cases by other emergent environmental mycobacteria. Epidemiologic surveys performed in Europe, North America and New Zealand have demonstrated the existence and importance of environmental and wildlife reservoirs of mycobacterial infections that limit the attempts of disease control programmes. The aim of this review is to examine the zoonotic aspects of mycobacteria transmitted from the environment and wildlife. This work is focused on the species of two main groups of mycobacteria classified as important pathogens for humans and animals: first, M. bovis, the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis, which belongs to the M. tuberculosis complex and has a broad host range including wildlife, captive wildlife, domestic livestock, non-human primates and humans; the second group examined, is the M. avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) which includes M. avium ssp. avium causing major health problems in AIDS patients and M. avium ssp. paratuberculosis the etiological agent of Johne disease in cattle and identified in patients with Crohn disease. MAC agents, in addition to a broad host range, are environmental mycobacteria found in numerous biotopes including the soil, water, aerosols, protozoa, deep litter and fresh tropical vegetation. This review examines the possible reservoirs of these pathogens in the environment and in wildlife, their role as sources of infection in humans and animals and their health impact on humans. The possibilities of control and management programmes for these mycobacterial infections are examined with regards to the importance of their natural reservoirs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Biet","given":"Franck"},{"family":"Boschiroli","given":"Maria Laura"},{"family":"Thorel","given":"Marie Fran�oise"},{"family":"Guilloteau","given":"Laurence A."}],"citation-key":"biet2005ZoonoticAspectsMycobacterium","container-title":"Veterinary Research","DOI":"10.1051/vetres:2005001","ISSN":"0928-4249, 1297-9716","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,5]]},"language":"en","page":"411-436","source":"Crossref","title":"Zoonotic aspects of <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> and <i>Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare</i> complex (MAC)","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.edpsciences.org/10.1051/vetres:2005001","volume":"36"},

Traditional phylogenetic trees for Y. pestis based on sequence comparison have short internal branches and low bootstrap supports as only a small number of nucleotide substitutions have occurred. On the other hand, even a small number of genome rearrangements may resolve topological ambiguities in a phylogenetic tree. We reconstructed phylogenetic trees based on genome rearrangements using several popular approaches such as Maximum likelihood for Gene Order and the Bayesian model of genome rearrangements by inversions. We also reconciled phylogenetic trees for each of the three CRISPR loci to obtain an integrated scenario of the CRISPR cassette evolution. Analysis of contradictions between the obtained evolutionary trees yielded numerous parallel inversions and gain/loss events. Our data indicate that an integrated analysis of sequence-based and inversion-based trees enhances the resolution of phylogenetic reconstruction. In contrast, reconstructions of strain relationships based on solely CRISPR loci may not be reliable, as the history is obscured by large deletions, obliterating the order of spacer gains. Similarly, numerous parallel gene losses preclude reconstruction of phylogeny based on gene content.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Bochkareva","given":"Olga O."},{"family":"Dranenko","given":"Natalia O."},{"family":"Ocheredko","given":"Elena S."},{"family":"Kanevsky","given":"German M."},{"family":"Lozinsky","given":"Yaroslav N."},{"family":"Khalaycheva","given":"Vera A."},{"family":"Artamonova","given":"Irena I."},{"family":"Gelfand","given":"Mikhail S."}],"citation-key":"bochkareva2018GenomeRearrangementsPhylogeny","container-title":"PeerJ","DOI":"10.7717/peerj.4545","ISSN":"2167-8359","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,27]]},"language":"en","page":"e4545","source":"Crossref","title":"Genome rearrangements and phylogeny reconstruction in <i>Yersinia pestis</i>","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://peerj.com/articles/4545","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"bolanos2019OttomansGlobalCrises","abstract":"The cholera and plague pandemics of the 19th and early 20h centuries shaped Ottoman state-building and expansionist efforts in Iraq and the Gulf in significant ways. For Ottoman officials, these pandemics brought attention to the possible role of Qajar and British subjects in spreading cholera and plague, as well as the relationship between Iraq's ecology and recurring outbreaks. These developments paved the way for the expansion of Ottoman health institutions, such as quarantines, and the emergence of new conceptions of public health in the region. Specifically, quarantines proved instrumental not only to the delineation of the Ottoman–Qajar border, but also to defining an emerging Ottoman role in shaping Gulf affairs. Moreover, the Ottomans’ use of quarantines and simultaneous efforts to develop sanitary policies informed by local ecological realities signal a localized and ad hoc approach to disease prevention that has been overlooked. Ultimately, this study demonstrates that environmental factors operating on global and regional scales were just as important as geopolitical factors in shaping Ottoman rule in Iraq and the Gulf during the late Ottoman period.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Bolaños","given":"Isacar A."}],"citation-key":"bolanos2019OttomansGlobalCrises","container-title":"International Journal of Middle East Studies","DOI":"10.1017/S0020743819000667","ISSN":"0020-7438, 1471-6380","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,11]]},"language":"en","page":"603-620","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"The Ottomans during the global crises of cholera and plague: the View from Iraq and the Gulf.","title-short":"THE OTTOMANS DURING THE GLOBAL CRISES OF CHOLERA AND PLAGUE","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-middle-east-studies/article/ottomans-during-the-global-crises-of-cholera-and-plague-the-view-from-iraq-and-the-gulf/82A6A0E7CF8BD2138FA230AE4189057E","volume":"51"},
  {"id":"boldsen2009LeprosyMedievalDenmark","abstract":"A total of 3033 skeletons from 11 medieval Danish cemeteries and 99 skeletons from the North Scandinavian medieval site of Westerhus were examined for seven lesions indicative of leprosy. The seven lesions are: rounding to the edge of the nasal aperture, degeneration of spina nasalis anterior, degeneration of the alveolar process of the pre-maxilla, porosity or perforation of the palatine process of maxilla, sub-periostal exostoses on the fibula, general swelling of the shaft of the fibula, and degeneration of the 5 th metatarsal bone. The dichotomous scores of these lesions were used to estimate sensitivity and specificity of the lesion scores in relation to leprosy and to estimate sample point prevalence of leprosy at death among adults. In turn the estimates of sensitivity and specificity were used to calculate an individual comprehensive statistic, λ, indicating leprosy status. Among adults the λ statistic did not associate with age at death, but this cannot be taken as a sign of lack of selective mortality for leprosy but a combination of the opposing effects of long waiting time before developing leprosy related lesions and short survival with these lesions. In urban communities sufferers of leprosy were institutionalized when the leprosarium was established (in Odense around 1275); in rural communities this did not happen but the pattern of burial does indicate an internal segregation of sufferers. In the early Middle Ages (AD 1150-1350) the point prevalence at death among adults of leprosy was higher in rural (25-40 percent) than in urban (10-20 percent) communities, and villages close to town showed lower frequencies of leprosy than villages situated further away from these centers. Leprosy declined in the late Middle Ages, first in towns and cities, later in rural communities. In Odense and Malmö it appears that leprosy was effectively eliminated by 1350 whereas there were still sufferers of leprosy at Øm Kloster around 1550. Leprosy appears to have been less common in North Scandinavia than in South Scandinavia, and there are some indications that leprosy was much more common in the Sámi population than in the North population of North Scandinavia. It is suggested that the rapid and early decline of leprosy in the towns was caused by the breaking of chains of infection by institutionalizing the most affected sufferers from leprosy. In rural communities it is suggested that the later decline of leprosy was brought about by a natural vaccination with the active substance in the Calmette vaccine, Mycobacterium bovis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Boldsen","given":"Jesper L."}],"citation-key":"boldsen2009LeprosyMedievalDenmark","container-title":"Anthropologischer Anzeiger","ISSN":"0003-5548","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"page":"407-425","publisher":"E.

  {"id":"bosGeneticInvestigationsBlack","abstract":"This dissertation discusses molecular analyses of dental and skeletal material from victims of the Black Death with the goal of both identifying and describing the evolutionary history of the causative agent of the pandemic. Through this work, Yersinia pestis DNA was successfully identified in skeletal material from a welldocumented Black Death burial ground, the East Smithfield cemetery of London, England (1348 -1350). The thesis presents two major methodological advancements in the field of ancient pathogen research: 1) it describes a protocol to confirm the authenticity of ancient pathogen DNA, thus circumventing tenuous issues relating to modern contaminants, and 2) it demonstrates the applicability of DNA capture methods to isolate ancient pathogen DNA from its complex metagenomic background common to ancient DNA extracts. The dissertation is comprised of three publications. The first, submitted to the journal BMC Systems Biology, describes a computational software program for oligo design that has applications to PCR, and capture techniques such as primer extension capture (PEC) and array-based capture. The second manuscript, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, presents a novel capture technique for retrieval of the pestis-specific pPCP (9.6kb) plasmid which can be used as a simple screening tool for the presence of Y. pestis DNA in ancient remains, and describes a method for authenticating ancient pathogen DNA. The third paper, published in the journal Nature, presents a draft genome of Yersinia pestis isolated from the individuals of the East Smithfield collection, thus presenting the first ancient pathogen genome in published literature. Evolutionary changes as they relate to phylogenetic placement and the evolution of virulence are discussed within an anthropological framework.","author":[{"family":"Bos","given":"Kirsten"}],"citation-key":"bosGeneticInvestigationsBlack","language":"en","page":"234","source":"Zotero","title":"Genetic Investigations into the Black Death","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"bouckaert2019BEASTAdvancedSoftware","abstract":"Elaboration of Bayesian phylogenetic inference methods has continued at pace in recent years with major new advances in nearly all aspects of the joint modelling of evolutionary data. It is increasingly appreciated that some evolutionary questions can only be adequately answered by combining evidence from multiple independent sources of data, including genome sequences, sampling dates, phenotypic data, radiocarbon dates, fossil occurrences, and biogeographic range information among others. Including all relevant data into a single joint model is very challenging both conceptually and computationally. Advanced computational software packages that allow robust development of compatible (sub-)models which can be composed into a full model hierarchy have played a key role in these developments. Developing such software frameworks is increasingly a major scientific activity in its own right, and comes with specific challenges, from practical software design, development and engineering challenges to statistical and conceptual modelling challenges. BEAST 2 is one such computational software platform, and was first announced over 4 years ago. Here we describe a series of major new developments in the BEAST 2 core platform and model hierarchy that have occurred since the first release of the software, culminating in the recent 2.5 release.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Bouckaert","given":"Remco"},{"family":"Vaughan","given":"Timothy G."},{"family":"Barido-Sottani","given":"Joëlle"},{"family":"Duchêne","given":"Sebastián"},{"family":"Fourment","given":"Mathieu"},{"family":"Gavryushkina","given":"Alexandra"},{"family":"Heled","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Graham"},{"family":"Kühnert","given":"Denise"},{"family":"Maio","given":"Nicola De"},{"family":"Matschiner","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Mendes","given":"Fábio K."},{"family":"Müller","given":"Nicola F."},{"family":"Ogilvie","given":"Huw A."},{"family":"Plessis","given":"Louis","dropping-particle":"du"},{"family":"Popinga","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Rambaut","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Rasmussen","given":"David"},{"family":"Siveroni","given":"Igor"},{"family":"Suchard","given":"Marc A."},{"family":"Wu","given":"Chieh-Hsi"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Dong"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Chi"},{"family":"Stadler","given":"Tanja"},{"family":"Drummond","given":"Alexei J."}],"citation-key":"bouckaert2019BEASTAdvancedSoftware","container-title":"PLOS Computational Biology","container-title-short":"PLOS Computational Biology","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006650","ISSN":"1553-7358","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,8]]},"language":"en","page":"e1006650","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"BEAST 2.5: An advanced software platform for Bayesian evolutionary analysis","title-short":"BEAST 2.5","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006650","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"brozou2021LeprosyMedievalDenmark","abstract":"Objectives By focusing on two Danish leprosaria (Næstved and Odense; 13th–16th c. CE) and using diet and origin as proxies, we follow a multi-isotopic approach to reconstruct life histories of patients and investigate how leprosy affected both institutionalized individuals and the medieval Danish community as a whole. Materials and Methods We combine archaeology, historical sources, biological anthropology, isotopic analyses (δ13C, δ15N, δ34S, 87Sr/86Sr) and radiocarbon dating, and further analyze bones with different turnover rates (ribs and long bones). Results The δ13C, δ15N and δ34S results indicate a C3 terrestrial diet with small contributions of marine protein for leprosy patients and individuals from other medieval Danish sites. A similar diet is seen through time, between males and females, and patients with and without changes on facial bones. The isotopic comparison between ribs and long bones reveals no significant dietary change. The δ34S and 87Sr/86Sr results suggest that patients were local to the regions of the leprosaria. Moreover, the radiocarbon dates show a mere 50% agreement with the arm position dating method used in Denmark. Conclusions A local origin for the leprosy patients is in line with historical evidence, unlike the small dietary contribution of marine protein. Although only 10% of the analyzed individuals have rib/long bone offsets that undoubtedly show a dietary shift, the data appear to reveal a pattern for 25 individuals (out of 50), with elevated δ13C and/or δ15N values in the ribs compared to the long bones, which points toward a communal type of diet and reveals organizational aspects of the institution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Brozou","given":"Anastasia"},{"family":"Fuller","given":"Benjamin T."},{"family":"Grimes","given":"Vaughan"},{"family":"Lynnerup","given":"Niels"},{"family":"Boldsen","given":"Jesper L."},{"family":"Jørkov","given":"Marie Louise"},{"family":"Pedersen","given":"Dorthe Dangvard"},{"family":"Olsen","given":"Jesper"},{"family":"Mannino","given":"Marcello A."}],"citation-key":"brozou2021LeprosyMedievalDenmark","container-title":"American Journal of Physical Anthropology","DOI":"10.1002/ajpa.24339","ISSN":"1096-8644","issue":"n/a","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,6]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ajpa.24339","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Leprosy in medieval Denmark: Exploring life histories through a multi-tissue and multi-isotopic approach","title-short":"Leprosy in medieval Denmark","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajpa.24339","volume":"n/a"},

Previous phylogenetic reconstruction of influenza A (H3N2) evolution using the hemagglutinin gene revealed an excess of nonsilent substitutions assigned to the terminal branches of the tree. We investigate two hypotheses to explain this observation. The first hypothesis is that the excess reflects mutations that were either not present or were at low frequency in the viral sample isolated from its human host, and that these mutations increased in frequency during passage of the virus in embryonated eggs. A set of 22 codons known to undergo such “host-mediated” mutations showed a significant excess of mutations assigned to branches attaching sequences from egg-cultured (as opposed to cell-cultured) isolates to the tree. Our second hypothesis is that the remaining excess results from sampling bias. Influenza surveillance is purposefully biased toward sequencing antigenically dissimilar strains in an effort to identify new variants that may signal the need to update the vaccine. This bias produces an excess of mutations assigned to terminal branches simply because an isolate with no close relatives is by definition attached to the tree by a relatively long branch. Simulations show that the magnitude of excess mutations we observed in the hemagglutinin tree is consistent with expectations based on our sampling protocol. Sampling bias does not affect inferences about evolution drawn from phylogenetic analyses. However, if possible, the excess caused by host-mediated mutations should be removed from studies of the evolution of influenza viruses as they replicate in their human hosts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Bush","given":"Robin M."},{"family":"Smith","given":"Catherine B."},{"family":"Cox","given":"Nancy J."},{"family":"Fitch","given":"Walter M."}],"citation-key":"bush2000EffectsPassageHistory","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.97.13.6974","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"13","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000,6,20]]},"language":"en","page":"6974-6980","PMID":"10860959","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Colloquium Paper","source":"www-pnas-org.libaccess.lib.mcmaster.ca","title":"Effects of passage history and sampling bias on phylogenetic reconstruction of human influenza A evolution","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/content/97/13/6974","volume":"97"},

  {"id":"campbell2016GreatTransitionClimate","abstract":"In the fourteenth century the Old World witnessed a series of profound and abrupt changes in the trajectory of long-established historical trends. Transcontinental networks of exchange fractured and an era of economic contraction and demographic decline dawned from which Latin Christendom would not begin to emerge until its voyages of discovery at the end of the fifteenth century. In a major new study of this 'Great Transition', Bruce Campbell assesses the contributions of commercial recession, war, climate change, and eruption of the Black Death to a far-reaching reversal of fortunes from which no part of Eurasia was spared. The book synthesises a wealth of new historical, palaeo-ecological and biological evidence, including estimates of national income, reconstructions of past climates, and genetic analysis of DNA extracted from the teeth of plague victims, to provide a fresh account of the creation, collapse and realignment of Western Europe's late medieval commercial economy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Campbell","given":"Bruce M.

Instead, plague persists in remote, rural hinterlands: areas less visible in the written sources of late medieval Europe. Plague spreads as fleas move from relatively resistant rodents, which serve as “maintenance hosts,” to an array of more susceptible rural mammals, now called “amplifying hosts.” Using sources relevant to plague in thinly populated Central and Western Alpine regions, this paper postulates that Alpine Europe could have been a region of plague persistence via its population of wild rodents, particularly the Alpine marmot.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Carmichael","given":"Ann G."}],"citation-key":"carmichael2015PlaguePersistenceWestern","container-title":"The Medieval Globe","ISSN":"2377-3553","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"page":"157-191","publisher":"Arc Humanities Press","source":"Project MUSE","title":"Plague persistence in Western Europe: a hypothesis","title-short":"Plague Persistence in Western Europe","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://muse.jhu.edu/article/758488","volume":"1"},
  {"id":"case2017SkeletalKinshipAnalysis","abstract":"Abstract Developmental anomalies of the skeleton are often treated as mere curiosities, but in some contexts, they may prove useful to bioarchaeologists for answering questions about the past. One such use can be found in skeletal kinship analysis, where discrete traits can help to identify close genetic relatives in archaeological cemeteries. Previous research suggests that discrete traits used for skeletal kinship analysis should have several characteristics—they must obviously be heritable, but in addition, they should be easy to score as present or absent, their frequencies should not vary by age or sex, and they should be low frequency traits. Low frequency traits are less likely than higher frequency traits to be found in two individuals merely by chance. In this study, we consider 17 developmental anomalies of the human foot as candidates for use in skeletal kinship analysis. The traits are evaluated in terms of the characteristics described above, after which kinship analyses are attempted on two different populations. Ten of the anomalies are found to be good candidates for skeletal kinship analysis, including accessory navicular, four different forms of brachydactyly, three types of tarsal coalition, and two forms of the os intermetatarseum. When frequencies of these traits were examined and compared to a reference sample in three cemeteries, however, only a single group of six possible genetic relatives were identified. The results suggest that skeletal kinship analysis using individual heritable traits is perhaps best applied to small cemeteries or burial clusters rather than larger cemeteries containing many different lineages.

  {"id":"caseyPlagueDotText","abstract":"The design of models that govern diseases in population is commonly built on\ninformation and data gathered from past outbreaks.

  {"id":"chang2016PathogenMetadataPlatform","abstract":"Background: Pathogen metadata includes information about where and when a pathogen was collected and the type of environment it came from. Along with genomic nucleotide sequence data, this metadata is growing rapidly and becoming a valuable resource not only for research but for biosurveillance and public health. However, current freely available tools for analyzing this data are geared towards bioinformaticians and/or do not provide summaries and visualizations needed to readily interpret results.\nResults: We designed a platform to easily access and summarize data about pathogen samples. The software includes a PostgreSQL database that captures metadata useful for disease outbreak investigations, and scripts for downloading and parsing data from NCBI BioSample and BioProject into the database. The software provides a user interface to query metadata and obtain standardized results in an exportable, tab-delimited format. To visually summarize results, the user interface provides a 2D histogram for user-selected metadata types and mapping of geolocated entries. The software is built on the LabKey data platform, an open-source data management platform, which enables developers to add functionalities. We demonstrate the use of the software in querying for a pathogen serovar and for genome sequence identifiers.\nConclusions: This software enables users to create a local database for pathogen metadata, populate it with data from NCBI, easily query the data, and obtain visual summaries. Some of the components, such as the database, are modular and can be incorporated into other data platforms.

We compare the results of simulations to empirical results from analyses of a real rate-heterogeneous taxon – Australian grass trees (Xanthorrhoea) – whose substitution rate is slower than in its sister groups, as determined by relative rate tests.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Crisp","given":"Michael D."},{"family":"Hardy","given":"Nate B."},{"family":"Cook","given":"Lyn G."}],"citation-key":"crisp2014ClockModelMakes","container-title":"BMC Evolutionary Biology","container-title-short":"BMC Evolutionary Biology","DOI":"10.1186/s12862-014-0263-3","ISSN":"1471-2148","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,12,19]]},"page":"263","source":"BioMed Central","title":"Clock model makes a large difference to age estimates of long-stemmed clades with no internal calibration: a test using Australian grasstrees","title-short":"Clock model makes a large difference to age estimates of long-stemmed clades with no internal calibration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12862-014-0263-3","volume":"14"},

The plagues of 1563, 1603, 1625, and 1665 appear of roughly equal magnitude, with deaths running at five to six times their usual rate, but the impact on wealthier central parishes falls markedly through time. Tracking the weekly spread of plague, we find no evidence that plague emerged first in the docks, and in many cases elevated mortality emerges first in the poor northern suburbs. Looking at the seasonal pattern of mortality, we find that the characteristic autumn spike associated with plague continued into the early 1700s. Natural increase improved as smaller crises disappeared after 1590, but fewer than half of those born survived childhood.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Cummins","given":"Neil"},{"family":"Kelly","given":"Morgan"},{"family":"Ó Gráda","given":"Cormac"}],"citation-key":"cummins2016LivingStandardsPlague","container-title":"The Economic History Review","DOI":"10.1111/ehr.12098","ISSN":"1468-0289","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ehr.12098","page":"3-34","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Living standards and plague in London, 1560–1665","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ehr.12098","volume":"69"},

Here we sequence the genomes of 137 ancient humans (about 1× average coverage), covering a period of 4,000 years, to understand the population history of the Eurasian steppes after the Bronze Age migrations. We find that the genetics of the Scythian groups that dominated the Eurasian steppes throughout the Iron Age were highly structured, with diverse origins comprising Late Bronze Age herders, European farmers and southern Siberian hunter-gatherers. Later, Scythians admixed with the eastern steppe nomads who formed the Xiongnu confederations, and moved westward in about the second or third century bc, forming the Hun traditions in the fourth–fifth century ad, and carrying with them plague that was basal to the Justinian plague. These nomads were further admixed with East Asian groups during several short-term khanates in the Medieval period. These historical events transformed the Eurasian steppes from being inhabited by Indo-European speakers of largely West Eurasian ancestry to the mostly Turkic-speaking groups of the present day, who are primarily of East Asian ancestry.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Damgaard","given":"Peter de Barros"},{"family":"Marchi","given":"Nina"},{"family":"Rasmussen","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Peyrot","given":"Michaël"},{"family":"Renaud","given":"Gabriel"},{"family":"Korneliussen","given":"Thorfinn"},{"family":"Moreno-Mayar","given":"J.

  {"id":"dean2018HumanEctoparasitesSpread","abstract":"Plague is infamous as the cause of the Black Death (1347–1353) and later Second Pandemic (14th to 19th centuries CE), when devastating epidemics occurred throughout Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. Despite the historical significance of the disease, the mechanisms underlying the spread of plague in Europe are poorly understood. While it is commonly assumed that rats and their fleas spread plague during the Second Pandemic, there is little historical and archaeological support for such a claim. Here, we show that human ectoparasites, like body lice and human fleas, might be more likely than rats to have caused the rapidly developing epidemics in pre-Industrial Europe. Such an alternative transmission route explains many of the notable epidemiological differences between historical and modern plague epidemics., Plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, can spread through human populations by multiple transmission pathways. Today, most human plague cases are bubonic, caused by spillover of infected fleas from rodent epizootics, or pneumonic, caused by inhalation of infectious droplets. However, little is known about the historical spread of plague in Europe during the Second Pandemic (14–19th centuries), including the Black Death, which led to high mortality and recurrent epidemics for hundreds of years. Several studies have suggested that human ectoparasite vectors, such as human fleas (Pulex irritans) or body lice (Pediculus humanus humanus), caused the rapidly spreading epidemics. Here, we describe a compartmental model for plague transmission by a human ectoparasite vector. Using Bayesian inference, we found that this model fits mortality curves from nine outbreaks in Europe better than models for pneumonic or rodent transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346–1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Dean","given":"Katharine R."},{"family":"Krauer","given":"Fabienne"},{"family":"Walløe","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Lingjærde","given":"Ole Christian"},{"family":"Bramanti","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Stenseth","given":"Nils Chr."},{"family":"Schmid","given":"Boris V."}],"citation-key":"dean2018HumanEctoparasitesSpread","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","container-title-short":"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1715640115","ISSN":"0027-8424","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,6]]},"page":"1304-1309","PMCID":"PMC5819418","PMID":"29339508","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Human ectoparasites and the spread of plague in Europe during the Second Pandemic","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5819418/","volume":"115"},

  {"id":"dewitte2014MortalityRiskSurvival","abstract":"The medieval Black Death (c. 1347-1351) was one of the most devastating epidemics in human history. It killed tens of millions of Europeans, and recent analyses have shown that the disease targeted elderly adults and individuals who had been previously exposed to physiological stressors. Following the epidemic, there were improvements in standards of living, particularly in dietary quality for all socioeconomic strata. This study investigates whether the combination of the selective mortality of the Black Death and post-epidemic improvements in standards of living had detectable effects on survival and mortality in London. Samples are drawn from several pre- and post-Black Death London cemeteries. The preBlack Death sample comes from the Guildhall Yard (n = 75) and St. Nicholas Shambles (n = 246) cemeteries, which date to the 11th–12th centuries, and from two phases within the St. Mary Spital cemetery, which date to between 1120-1300 (n = 143). The St. Mary Graces cemetery (n = 133) was in use from 1350–1538 and thus represents post-epidemic demographic conditions. By applying Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Gompertz hazard model to transition analysis age estimates, and controlling for changes in birth rates, this study examines differences in survivorship and mortality risk between the pre- and post-Black Death populations of London. The results indicate that there are significant differences in survival and mortality risk, but not birth rates, between the two time periods, which suggest improvements in health following the Black Death, despite repeated outbreaks of plague in the centuries after the Black Death.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,8]]},"author":[{"family":"DeWitte","given":"Sharon N."}],"citation-key":"dewitte2014MortalityRiskSurvival","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0096513","editor":[{"family":"Noymer","given":"Andrew"}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,5,7]]},"language":"en","page":"e96513","source":"Crossref","title":"Mortality Risk and Survival in the Aftermath of the Medieval Black Death","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0096513","volume":"9"},

Besides the deaths of important men by plague, it is suggested that the endemic nature of plague during the early Islamic Empire may have significantly retarded population growth and debilitated Muslim society in Syria and Iraq during the Umaiyad Period.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,29]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Dols","given":"Michael W."}],"citation-key":"dols1974PlagueEarlyIslamic","container-title":"Journal of the American Oriental Society","DOI":"10.2307/600071","ISSN":"0003-0279","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1974]]},"page":"371-383","publisher":"American Oriental Society","source":"JSTOR","title":"Plague in early Islamic history","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/600071","volume":"94"},
  {"id":"dornburg2012RelaxedClocksInferences","abstract":"Various nucleotide substitution models have been developed to accommodate among lineage rate heterogeneity, thereby relaxing the assumptions of the strict molecular clock. Recently developed \"uncorrelated relaxed clock\" and \"random local clock\" (RLC) models allow decoupling of nucleotide substitution rates between descendant lineages and are thus predicted to perform better in the presence of lineage-specific rate heterogeneity. However, it is uncertain how these models perform in the presence of punctuated shifts in substitution rate, especially between closely related clades. Using cetaceans (whales and dolphins) as a case study, we test the performance of these two substitution models in estimating both molecular rates and divergence times in the presence of substantial lineage-specific rate heterogeneity. Our RLC analyses of whole mitochondrial genome alignments find evidence for up to ten clade-specific nucleotide substitution rate shifts in cetaceans. We provide evidence that in the uncorrelated relaxed clock framework, a punctuated shift in the rate of molecular evolution within a subclade results in posterior rate estimates that are either misled or intermediate between the disparate rate classes present in baleen and toothed whales. Using simulations, we demonstrate abrupt changes in rate isolated to one or a few lineages in the phylogeny can mislead rate and age estimation, even when the node of interest is calibrated. We further demonstrate how increasing prior age uncertainty can bias rate and age estimates, even while the 95% highest posterior density around age estimates decreases; in other words, increased precision for an inaccurate estimate. We interpret the use of external calibrations in divergence time studies in light of these results, suggesting that rate shifts at deep time scales may mislead inferences of absolute molecular rates and ages.","author":[{"family":"Dornburg","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Brandley","given":"Matthew C."},{"family":"McGowen","given":"Michael R."},{"family":"Near","given":"Thomas J."}],"citation-key":"dornburg2012RelaxedClocksInferences","container-title":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Mol Biol Evol","DOI":"10.1093/molbev/msr228","ISSN":"1537-1719","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,2]]},"language":"eng","page":"721-736","PMID":"21926070","source":"PubMed","title":"Relaxed clocks and inferences of heterogeneous patterns of nucleotide substitution and divergence time estimates across whales and dolphins (Mammalia: Cetacea)","title-short":"Relaxed clocks and inferences of heterogeneous patterns of nucleotide substitution and divergence time estimates across whales and dolphins (Mammalia","type":"article-journal","volume":"29"},

However, confident diagnosis of ancient septicemia solely on the basis of historical clinical observations is not possible. The lack of suitable infected material has prevented direct demonstration of ancient septicemia; thus, the history of most infections such as plague remains hypothetical. The durability of dental pulp, together with its natural sterility, makes it a suitable material on which to base such research. We hypothesized that it would be a lasting refuge for Yersinia pestis, the plague agent. DNA extracts were made from the dental pulp of 12 unerupted teeth extracted from skeletons excavated from 16th and 18th century French graves of persons thought to have died of plague (“plague teeth”) and from 7 ancient negative control teeth. PCRs incorporating ancient DNA extracts and primers specific for the human β-globin gene demonstrated the absence of inhibitors in these preparations. The incorporation of primers specific for Y. pestis rpoB (the RNA polymerase β-subunit-encoding gene) and the recognized virulence-associated pla (the plasminogen activator-encoding gene) repeatedly yielded products that had a nucleotide sequence indistinguishable from that of modern day isolates of the bacterium. The specific pla sequence was obtained from 6 of 12 plague skeleton teeth but 0 of 7 negative controls (P < 0.034, Fisher exact test). A nucleic acid-based confirmation of ancient plague was achieved for historically identified victims, and we have confirmed the presence of the disease at the end of 16th century in France. Dental pulp is an attractive target in the quest to determine the etiology of septicemic illnesses detected in ancient corpses. Molecular techniques could be applied to this material to resolve historical outbreaks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Drancourt","given":"Michel"},{"family":"Aboudharam","given":"Gérard"},{"family":"Signoli","given":"Michel"},{"family":"Dutour","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Raoult","given":"Didier"}],"citation-key":"drancourt1998Detection400yearoldYersinia","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.95.21.12637","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"21","issued":{"date-parts":[[1998,10,13]]},"language":"en","page":"12637-12640","PMID":"9770538","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Biological Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Detection of 400-year-old Yersinia pestis DNA in human dental pulp: An approach to the diagnosis of ancient septicemia","title-short":"Detection of 400-year-old Yersinia pestis DNA in human dental pulp","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/95/21/12637","volume":"95"},

Despite their dominance in phylogenetic inference, it is evident that both are biologically unrealistic and that the real evolutionary process lies between these two extremes. Fortunately, intermediate models employing relaxed molecular clocks have been described. These models open the gate to a new field of “relaxed phylogenetics.” Here we introduce a new approach to performing relaxed phylogenetic analysis. We describe how it can be used to estimate phylogenies and divergence times in the face of uncertainty in evolutionary rates and calibration times. Our approach also provides a means for measuring the clocklikeness of datasets and comparing this measure between different genes and phylogenies. We find no significant rate autocorrelation among branches in three large datasets, suggesting that autocorrelated models are not necessarily suitable for these data. In addition, we place these datasets on the continuum of clocklikeness between a strict molecular clock and the alternative unrooted extreme. Finally, we present analyses of 102 bacterial, 106 yeast, 61 plant, 99 metazoan, and 500 primate alignments. From these we conclude that our method is phylogenetically more accurate and precise than the traditional unrooted model while adding the ability to infer a timescale to evolution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Drummond","given":"Alexei J."},{"family":"Ho","given":"Simon Y.

This involves the use of molecular-clock methods, calibrated by the sampling times of the viral sequences. However, the spread of these sampling times is not always sufficient to allow the substitution rate to be estimated accurately. We conducted Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of simulated virus data to evaluate the performance of the date-randomization test, which is sometimes used to investigate whether time-structured data sets have temporal signal. An estimate of the substitution rate passes this test if its mean does not fall within the 95% credible intervals of rate estimates obtained using replicate data sets in which the sampling times have been randomized. We find that the test sometimes fails to detect rate estimates from data with no temporal signal. This error can be minimized by using a more conservative criterion, whereby the 95% credible interval of the estimate with correct sampling times should not overlap with those obtained with randomized sampling times. We also investigated the behavior of the test when the sampling times are not uniformly distributed throughout the tree, which sometimes occurs in empirical data sets. The test performs poorly in these circumstances, such that a modification to the randomization scheme is needed. Finally, we illustrate the behavior of the test in analyses of nucleotide sequences of cereal yellow dwarf virus.

  {"id":"duchene2016GenomescaleRatesEvolutionary","abstract":"Estimating the rates at which bacterial genomes evolve is critical to understanding major evolutionary and ecological processes such as disease emergence, long-term host–pathogen associations and short-term transmission patterns. The surge in bacterial genomic data sets provides a new opportunity to estimate these rates and reveal the factors that shape bacterial evolutionary dynamics. For many organisms estimates of evolutionary rate display an inverse association with the time-scale over which the data are sampled. However, this relationship remains unexplored in bacteria due to the difficulty in estimating genome-wide evolutionary rates, which are impacted by the extent of temporal structure in the data and the prevalence of recombination. We collected 36 whole genome sequence data sets from 16 species of bacterial pathogens to systematically estimate and compare their evolutionary rates and assess the extent of temporal structure in the absence of recombination. The majority (28/36) of data sets possessed sufficient clock-like structure to robustly estimate evolutionary rates. However, in some species reliable estimates were not possible even with ‘ancient DNA’ data sampled over many centuries, suggesting that they evolve very slowly or that they display extensive rate variation among lineages. The robustly estimated evolutionary rates spanned several orders of magnitude, from approximately 10−5 to 10−8 nucleotide substitutions per site year−1. This variation was negatively associated with sampling time, with this relationship best described by an exponential decay curve. To avoid potential estimation biases, such time-dependency should be considered when inferring evolutionary time-scales in bacteria.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Duchêne","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Holt","given":"Kathryn E."},{"family":"Weill","given":"François-Xavier"},{"family":"Le Hello","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Hawkey","given":"Jane"},{"family":"Edwards","given":"David J."},{"family":"Fourment","given":"Mathieu"},{"family":"Holmes","given":"Edward C."}],"citation-key":"duchene2016GenomescaleRatesEvolutionary","container-title":"Microbial Genomics","container-title-short":"Microb Genom","DOI":"10.1099/mgen.0.000094","ISSN":"2057-5858","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,11,30]]},"PMCID":"PMC5320706","PMID":"28348834","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Genome-scale rates of evolutionary change in bacteria","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5320706/","volume":"2"},
  {"id":"duchene2020BayesianEvaluationTemporal","abstract":"Phylogenetic methods can use the sampling times of molecular sequence data to calibrate the molecular clock, enabling the estimation of evolutionary rates and timescales for rapidly evolving pathogens and data sets containing ancient DNA samples. A key aspect of such calibrations is whether a sufficient amount of molecular evolution has occurred over the sampling time window, that is, whether the data can be treated as having come from a measurably evolving population. Here, we investigate the performance of a fully Bayesian evaluation of temporal signal (BETS) in sequence data. The method involves comparing the fit to the data of two models: a model in which the data are accompanied by the actual (heterochronous) sampling times, and a model in which the samples are constrained to be contemporaneous (isochronous). We conducted simulations under a wide range of conditions to demonstrate that BETS accurately classifies data sets according to whether they contain temporal signal or not, even when there is substantial among-lineage rate variation. We explore the behavior of this classification in analyses of five empirical data sets: modern samples of A/H1N1 influenza virus, the bacterium Bordetella pertussis, coronaviruses from mammalian hosts, ancient DNA from Hepatitis B virus, and mitochondrial genomes of dog species. Our results indicate that BETS is an effective alternative to other tests of temporal signal. In particular, this method has the key advantage of allowing a coherent assessment of the entire model, including the molecular clock and tree prior which are essential aspects of Bayesian phylodynamic analyses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Duchene","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Lemey","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Stadler","given":"Tanja"},{"family":"Ho","given":"Simon Y W"},{"family":"Duchene","given":"David A"},{"family":"Dhanasekaran","given":"Vijaykrishna"},{"family":"Baele","given":"Guy"}],"citation-key":"duchene2020BayesianEvaluationTemporal","container-title":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1093/molbev/msaa163","ISSN":"0737-4038","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,1]]},"page":"3363-3379","source":"Silverchair","title":"Bayesian evaluation of temporal signal in measurably evolving populations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaa163","volume":"37"},

  {"id":"duchene2020TemporalSignalPhylodynamic","abstract":"The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak marks the first time that large amounts of genome sequence data have been generated and made publicly available in near real time. Early analyses of these data revealed low sequence variation, a finding that is consistent with a recently emerging outbreak, but which raises the question of whether such data are sufficiently informative for phylogenetic inferences of evolutionary rates and time scales. The phylodynamic threshold is a key concept that refers to the point in time at which sufficient molecular evolutionary change has accumulated in available genome samples to obtain robust phylodynamic estimates. For example, before the phylodynamic threshold is reached, genomic variation is so low that even large amounts of genome sequences may be insufficient to estimate the virus’s evolutionary rate and the time scale of an outbreak. We collected genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from public databases at eight different points in time and conducted a range of tests of temporal signal to determine if and when the phylodynamic threshold was reached, and the range of inferences that could be reliably drawn from these data. Our results indicate that by 2 February 2020, estimates of evolutionary rates and time scales had become possible. Analyses of subsequent data sets, that included between 47 and 122 genomes, converged at an evolutionary rate of about 1.1 × 10−3 subs/site/year and a time of origin of around late November 2019. Our study provides guidelines to assess the phylodynamic threshold and demonstrates that establishing this threshold constitutes a fundamental step for understanding the power and limitations of early data in outbreak genome surveillance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Duchene","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Featherstone","given":"Leo"},{"family":"Haritopoulou-Sinanidou","given":"Melina"},{"family":"Rambaut","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Lemey","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Baele","given":"Guy"}],"citation-key":"duchene2020TemporalSignalPhylodynamic","container-title":"Virus Evolution","container-title-short":"Virus Evolution","DOI":"10.1093/ve/veaa061","ISSN":"2057-1577","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,1]]},"source":"Silverchair","title":"Temporal signal and the phylodynamic threshold of SARS-CoV-2","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/veaa061","volume":"6"},

En outre, le modèle de diffusion des épidémies de peste en Europe continentale est différent de celui des régions maritimes et cette maladie cesse plus tôt en Europe centrale.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Eckert","given":"Edward A."}],"citation-key":"eckert1978BoundaryFormationDiffusion","container-title":"Annales de Démographie Historique","DOI":"10.3406/adh.1978.1378","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1978]]},"language":"eng","page":"49-80","publisher":"Persée - Portail des revues scientifiques en SHS","source":"www.persee.fr","title":"Boundary formation and diffusion of plague : swiss epidemics from 1562 to 1669","title-short":"Boundary formation and diffusion of plague","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.persee.fr/doc/adh_0066-2062_1978_num_1978_1_1378","volume":"1978"},

Stylometry (computational stylistics) is concerned with the quantitative study of writing style, e.g. authorship veriﬁcation, an application which has considerable potential in forensic contexts, as well as historical research. In this paper we introduce the possibilities of stylo for computational text analysis, via a number of dummy case studies from English and French literature. We demonstrate how the package is particularly useful in the exploratory statistical analysis of texts, e.g. with respect to authorial writing style. Because stylo provides an attractive graphical user interface for high-level exploratory analyses, it is especially suited for an audience of novices, without programming skills (e.g. from the Digital Humanities). More experienced users can beneﬁt from our implementation of a series of standard pipelines for text processing, as well as a number of similarity metrics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Eder","given":"Maciej"},{"family":"Rybicki","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Kestemont","given":"Mike"}],"citation-key":"eder2016StylometryPackageComputational","container-title":"The R Journal","DOI":"10.32614/RJ-2016-007","ISSN":"2073-4859","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","page":"107","source":"Crossref","title":"Stylometry with R: A Package for Computational Text Analysis","title-short":"Stylometry with R","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2016/RJ-2016-007/index.html","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"emery2018AncientRomanMitochondrial","abstract":"Rome initiated several campaigns to expand, conquer, and enslave local Italic populations following the establishment of the republic in 504 BCE. However, the cultural and biological changes resulting from Roman subjugation across Italy remain a topic of intense historical debate. Although important, historic and archaeological lines of evidence fail to track the impact of forced enslavement and enculturation at individual and broader genetic scales and, more generally, offer fewer clues regarding the potential affinities of Roman period Italians to European, Near Eastern, western Asian and North African populations at this time. In this paper, we present the whole mitochondrial (mtDNA) genomes of 30 Roman period (1st–4th centuries CE) individuals buried in the Vagnari necropolis in southern Italy. We integrate the mtDNA data with previously published bioarchaeological and isotope (δ18O and 87Sr/86Sr) data for the Vagnari assemblage and compare Roman haplogroup composition to 15 newly sequenced mitochondrial genomes obtained from a pre-Roman Iron Age skeletal assemblage, located in close proximity to Vagnari. Additionally, we contrast our South Italian dataset with a further 332 complete ancient mtDNA genomes from the pan-Mediterranean region, Europe, western Asia and North African regions. Population pairwise ΦST values suggest that Roman Italians share closer genetic similarity to Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Armenian Iron Age populations from western and central Eurasia than with Iron Age Italians, Ptolemaic, and Roman period Egyptians. Vagnari individuals with δ18O, 87Sr/86Sr, and mtDNA data suggest a predominantly local demographic was employed at the site. However, two individuals belong to eastern Eurasian haplogroup D4b1c, indicating that the maternal ancestors of these two individuals migrated to South Italy prior to the 1st century CE. Additionally, we provide the first genetic evidence for possible maternal relatedness in a Roman period skeletal assemblage. Our research highlights the significance of integrating multiple lines of bioarchaeological data to inform interpretations about Roman colonial expansion and its impact on population structure.","author":[{"family":"Emery","given":"Matthew V."},{"family":"Duggan","given":"Ana T."},{"family":"Murchie","given":"Tyler J."},{"family":"Stark","given":"Robert J."},{"family":"Klunk","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Hider","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Eaton","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Karpinski","given":"Emil"},{"family":"Schwarcz","given":"Henry P."},{"family":"Poinar","given":"Hendrik N."},{"family":"Prowse","given":"Tracy L."}],"citation-key":"emery2018AncientRomanMitochondrial","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2018.04.036","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,1]]},"page":"200-209","title":"Ancient Roman mitochondrial genomes and isotopes reveal relationships and geographic origins at the local and pan-Mediterranean scales","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X17308568","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"eppinger2014GenomicEpidemiologyHaitian","abstract":"For centuries, cholera has been one of the most feared diseases. The causative agent Vibrio cholerae is a waterborne Gram-negative enteric pathogen eliciting a severe watery diarrheal disease. In October 2010, the seventh pandemic reached Haiti, a country that had not experienced cholera for more than a century. By using whole-genome sequence typing and mapping strategies of 116 serotype O1 strains from global sources, including 44 Haitian genomes, we present a detailed reconstructed evolutionary history of the seventh pandemic with a focus on the Haitian outbreak. We catalogued subtle genomic alterations at the nucleotide level in the genome core and architectural rearrangements from whole-genome map comparisons. Isolates closely related to the Haitian isolates caused several recent outbreaks in southern Asia. This study provides evidence for a single-source introduction of cholera from Nepal into Haiti followed by rapid, extensive, and continued clonal expansion. The phylogeographic patterns in both southern Asia and Haiti argue for the rapid dissemination of V. cholerae across the landscape necessitating real-time surveillance efforts to complement the whole-genome epidemiological analysis. As eradication efforts move forward, phylogeographic knowledge will be important for identifying persistent sources and monitoring success at regional levels. The results of molecular and epidemiological analyses of this outbreak suggest that an indigenous Haitian source of V. cholerae is unlikely and that an indigenous source has not contributed to the genomic evolution of this clade. IMPORTANCE In this genomic epidemiology study, we have applied high-resolution whole-genome-based sequence typing methodologies on a comprehensive set of genome sequences that have become available in the aftermath of the Haitian cholera epidemic. These sequence resources enabled us to reassess the degree of genomic heterogeneity within the Vibrio cholerae O1 serotype and to reﬁne boundaries and evolutionary relationships. The established phylogenomic framework showed how outbreak isolates ﬁt into the global phylogeographic patterns compared to a comprehensive globally and temporally diverse strain collection and provides strong molecular evidence that points to a nonindigenous source of the 2010 Haitian cholera outbreak and reﬁnes epidemiological standards used in outbreak investigations for outbreak inclusion/exclusion following the concept of genomic epidemiology. The generated phylogenomic data have major public health relevance in translating sequence-based information to assist in future diagnostic, epidemiological, surveillance, and forensic studies of cholera.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Eppinger","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Pearson","given":"Talima"},{"family":"Koenig","given":"Sara S.

  {"id":"eroshenko2019CirculationYersiniaPestis","abstract":"Aim. The present paper provides a comparative analysis of the phylogenetic relationship between Yersinia pestis strains isolated in the Volga-Ural sandy natural focus during the periods of 1912–1945 and 1963–2003, which were characterised by different levels of epidemic activity, in order to identify the spatiotemporal patterns in the circulation of the plague pathogen in the North Caspian region. Materials and methods. We studied the properties and performed whole-genome sequencing of 18 Y. pestis strains from the Volga-Ural sandy focus, along with 12 strains from other foci in the North Caspian and North Aral regions, isolated from 1912 to 2003. The phylogenetic analysis was performed drawing on the whole-genome SNP analysis, which was conducted on the basis of 2188 SNPs identified in the core genome using the Wombac 2.0 program. Maximum Likelihood Dendrogram (GTR model) was used for the analysis of phylogenetic relationships between strains. Results and discussion. All studied strains from the foci of the North Caspian region belong to the main subspecies (biovar medievalis) of the plague pathogen. These are highly virulent and epidemiologically dangerous strains. The whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of 30 strains from the Volga-Ural sandy focus, as well as adjacent plague foci, reveal that the strains (biovar medievalis) of two phylogenetic branches – 2.MED4 and 2.MED1 – were spread across the focus under study in the early 20th century. It is confirmed that 2.MED1 strains were the etiological agents of plague outbreaks in the Volga-Ural sandy focus during this period. The study revealed the presence of parallel evolutionary lines in 2.MED1 associated with plague outbreaks in the first half of the last century. In the second half of the 20th and early 21st centuries, the modern evolutionary line of 2.MED1 became widespread in the Volga-Ural sandy focus. The strains of this line are closely grouped, which indicates their close genetic relationship. Only sporadic cases of plague were recorded during this period. Modern strains from the Volga-Ural sandy focus (1963–2003), as well as the strains previously isolated there (1912–1945), do not originate from each other. These strains represent closely related, independent evolutionary branches, extending from the common trunk of 2.MED1. Modern strains originating from those of the North Aral desert focus (1945) form a separate cluster in the dendrogram. This suggests that, following a break in the 1950s, the Volga-Ural sandy focus was re-colonised by closely related strains from the North Aral region.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Eroshenko","given":"G.

  {"id":"eroshenko2021EvolutionCirculationYersinia","abstract":"According to the whole genome SNP analysis of 38 Yersinia pestis strains isolated in the foci of the Northern Caspian and Northern Aral Sea regions in the 20th–early 21st centuries, between 1912 and 2015, the spatial and temporal structure of the 2.MED population of a medieval biovar in this region was determined. A phylogenetic branch 2.MED4 was identified which preceded the 2.MED1 branch that diverged later. 2.MED1 strains became the etiological agent of high-mortality plague outbreaks that occurred in the Northern Caspian region at the beginning of the 20th century. Later in the 20th century, the 2.MED1 branch became widespread in the Caspian Sea region, Caucasus, and vast areas of Central Asia. Based on the data of phylogenetic analysis, as well as epidemiological and epizootiological data, we reconstructed the paths of spread of the 2.MED1 branch in the Northern Caspian Sea region and in the Northern subzone of the Central Asian deserts. It is shown, that the reason for the activation of plague foci in the Northern Caspian region in the second half of the 20th century after a long inter-epizootic period caused by cyclical climate warming was the return of 2.MED1 from the foci of the Northern Aral Sea region. This led to the formation of stable plague foci in the Northern Caspian Sea region and Pre-Caucasus, which manifested epizootic activity in the second half of the 20th and early 21st centuries.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Eroshenko","given":"Galina A."},{"family":"Popov","given":"Nikolay V."},{"family":"Al’khova","given":"Zhanna V."},{"family":"Kukleva","given":"Lyubov M."},{"family":"Balykova","given":"Alina N."},{"family":"Chervyakova","given":"Nadezhda S."},{"family":"Naryshkina","given":"Ekaterina A."},{"family":"Kutyrev","given":"Vladimir V."}],"citation-key":"eroshenko2021EvolutionCirculationYersinia","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0244615","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,11]]},"language":"en","page":"e0244615","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Evolution and circulation of <i>Yersinia pestis</i> in the Northern Caspian and Northern Aral Sea regions in the 20th-21st centuries","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0244615","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"esquivelgomezA58EpidemicDynamics","abstract":"Bayesian phylogenetic analysis allows for the estimation of the time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of sequences sampled at different times, as long as they prove to be 'measurably evolving', which means that the time between sampling dates was long enough to allow the appearance of a measurable amount of genetic changes. This 'temporal signal' can be tested with the software TempEst (Rambaut et al. 2016), which generates a regression of the root-to-tip genetic distance on sampling times and finds the best-fitting root that produces the lowest residual sum of squares. For the case of pathogen single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) alignments, containing both modern and ancient sequences, it is common to find positions with unknown nucleotides (gaps) that could generate problems in the phylogenetic reconstruction. Thus, the use of complete deletion alignments is fairly common. This practice, however, could cause the loss of potentially important information, so we aim to identify the most suitable deletion threshold for the proportion of unknown sites allowed for a given alignment before proceeding to analyze the data in BEAST. Here, I present the temporal signal of 204 whole-genome sequences of <em>Yersinia pestis</em>, a zoonotic gram-negative bacteria and causal agent of the bubonic, pneumonic, and systemic plagues. I demonstrate measurable temporal signal for the alignment with thresholds of 0–10 per cent for the proportion of unknown sites per SNP. The results showed that a complete deletion alignment presented the lowest correlation and greatest residual mean squared values. The best threshold depends on the method used to find the best root, but appears to be between 7–9 per cent.","author":[{"family":"Esquivel Gomez","given":"Luis R"},{"family":"Spyrou","given":"Maria A"},{"family":"Keller","given":"Marcel"},{"family":"Herbig","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Bos","given":"Kirsten I"},{"family":"Krause","given":"Johannes"},{"family":"Kühnert","given":"Denise"}],"citation-key":"esquivelgomezA58EpidemicDynamics","container-title":"Virus Evolution","DOI":"10.1093/ve/vez002.057","title":"A58 Epidemic dynamics of ancient disease outbreaks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/ve/article/doi/10.1093/ve/vez002.057/5552858?rss=1&utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound"},

  {"id":"faria2018GenomicEpidemiologicalMonitoring","abstract":"Arbovirus risk in Brazil\nDespite the existence of an effective vaccine for yellow fever, there are still almost 80,000 fatalities from this infection each year. Since 2016, there has been a resurgence of cases in Africa and South America—and this at a time when the vaccine is in short supply. The worry is that yellow fever will spread from the forests to the cities, because its vector, Aedes spp. mosquitoes, are globally ubiquitous. Faria et al. integrate genomic, epidemiological, and case distribution data from Brazil to estimate patterns of geographic spread, the risks of virus exposure, and the contributions of rural versus urban transmission (see the Perspective by Barrett). Currently, the yellow fever epidemic in Brazil seems to be driven by infections acquired while visiting forested areas and indicates spillover from susceptible wild primates.\nScience, this issue p. 894; see also p. 847\nThe yellow fever virus (YFV) epidemic in Brazil is the largest in decades. The recent discovery of YFV in Brazilian Aedes species mosquitos highlights a need to monitor the risk of reestablishment of urban YFV transmission in the Americas. We use a suite of epidemiological, spatial, and genomic approaches to characterize YFV transmission. We show that the age and sex distribution of human cases is characteristic of sylvatic transmission. Analysis of YFV cases combined with genomes generated locally reveals an early phase of sylvatic YFV transmission and spatial expansion toward previously YFV-free areas, followed by a rise in viral spillover to humans in late 2016. Our results establish a framework for monitoring YFV transmission in real time that will contribute to a global strategy to eliminate future YFV epidemics.\nMinION genomic and case data on a recent yellow fever epidemic indicate that most infections occurred during visits to forest regions.\nMinION genomic and case data on a recent yellow fever epidemic indicate that most infections occurred during visits to forest regions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Faria","given":"N.

  {"id":"featherstone2021InfectiousDiseasePhylodynamics","abstract":"Phylodynamic models use pathogen genome sequence data to infer epidemiological dynamics. With the increasing genomic surveillance of pathogens, especially during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, new practical questions about their use are emerging. One such question focuses on the inclusion of un-sequenced case occurrence data alongside sequenced data to improve phylodynamic analyses. This approach can be particularly valuable if sequencing efforts vary over time. Using simulations, we demonstrate that birth–death phylodynamic models can employ occurrence data to eliminate bias in estimates of the basic reproductive number due to misspecification of the sampling process. In contrast, the coalescent exponential model is robust to such sampling biases, but in the absence of a sampling model it cannot exploit occurrence data. Subsequent analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the northwest USA supports these results. We conclude that occurrence data are a valuable source of information in combination with birth–death models. These data should be used to bolster phylodynamic analyses of infectious diseases and other rapidly spreading species in the future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Featherstone","given":"Leo A."},{"family":"Di Giallonardo","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Holmes","given":"Edward C."},{"family":"Vaughan","given":"Timothy G."},{"family":"Duchêne","given":"Sebastián"}],"citation-key":"featherstone2021InfectiousDiseasePhylodynamics","container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.13620","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/2041-210X.13620","page":"1498-1507","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Infectious disease phylodynamics with occurrence data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.13620","volume":"12"},

In addition, we identify 19 false positive substitutions in a previously published lower-coverage Y. pestis genome from another archaeological site of the same time period and geographical region that is otherwise genetically identical to the high-coverage genome sequence reported here, suggesting low-genetic diversity of the plague during the sixth century in rural southern Germany.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Feldman","given":"Michal"},{"family":"Harbeck","given":"Michaela"},{"family":"Keller","given":"Marcel"},{"family":"Spyrou","given":"Maria A."},{"family":"Rott","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Trautmann","given":"Bernd"},{"family":"Scholz","given":"Holger C."},{"family":"Päffgen","given":"Bernd"},{"family":"Peters","given":"Joris"},{"family":"McCormick","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Bos","given":"Kirsten"},{"family":"Herbig","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Krause","given":"Johannes"}],"citation-key":"feldman2016HighCoverageYersiniaPestis","container-title":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1093/molbev/msw170","ISSN":"0737-4038","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,11,1]]},"page":"2911-2923","source":"Silverchair","title":"A High-Coverage Yersinia pestis Genome from a Sixth-Century Justinianic Plague Victim","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msw170","volume":"33"},
  {"id":"fell2022BioticFactorsLimit","abstract":"Aim: The distribution of Yersinia pestis, the pathogen that causes plague in humans, is reliant upon transmission between host species; however, the degree to which host species distributions dictate the distribution of Y.pestis, compared with limitations imposed by the environmental niche of Y.pestis per se, is debated. We test whether the present-day environmental niche of Y.pestis differs between its native range and an invaded range and whether biotic factors (host distributions) can explain observed discrepancies. Location: North America and Central Asia. Major taxa studied: Yersinia pestis. Methods: We use environmental niche models to determine whether the current climatic niche of Y.pestis differs between its native range in Asia and its invaded range in North America. We then test whether the inclusion of information on the distribution of host species improves the ability of models to capture the North American niche. We use geographical null models to guard against spurious correlations arising from spatially autocorrelated occurrence points. Results: The current climatic niche of Y.pestis differs between its native and invaded regions. The Asian niche overpredicted the distribution of Y.pestis across North America. Including biotic factors along with the native climatic niche increased niche overlap between the native and invaded models, and models containing only biotic factors performed better than the native climatic niche alone. Geographical null models confirmed that the increased niche overlap through inclusion of biotic factors did not, with a couple of exceptions, arise solely from spatially autocorrelated occurrences. Main conclusions: The current climatic niche in Central Asia differs from the current climatic niche in North America. Inclusion of biotic factors improved the fit of models to the Y.pestis distribution data in its invaded region better than climate variables alone. This highlights the importance of host species when investigating zoonotic disease introductions and suggests that climatic variables alone are insufficient to predict disease distribution in novel environments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Fell","given":"Henry G."},{"family":"Osborne","given":"Owen G."},{"family":"Jones","given":"Matthew D."},{"family":"Atkinson","given":"Steve"},{"family":"Tarr","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Keddie","given":"Suzanne H."},{"family":"Algar","given":"Adam C."}],"citation-key":"fell2022BioticFactorsLimit","container-title":"Global Ecology and Biogeography","DOI":"10.1111/geb.13453","ISSN":"1466-822X, 1466-8238","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,1]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Wiley","source":"nottingham-repository.worktribe.com","title":"Biotic factors limit the invasion of the plague pathogen (Yersinia pestis) in novel geographical settings","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://nottingham-repository.worktribe.com/index.php/output/7276245/biotic-factors-limit-the-invasion-of-the-plague-pathogen-yersinia-pestis-in-novel-geographical-settings"},

  {"id":"ferreira2008BayesianAnalysisElapsed","abstract":"The authors consider Bayesian analysis for continuous-time Markov chain models based on a conditional reference prior. For such models, inference of the elapsed time between chain observations depends heavily on the rate of decay of the prior as the elapsed time increases. Moreover, improper priors on the elapsed time may lead to improper posterior distributions. In addition, an infinitesimal rate matrix also characterizes this class of models. Experts often have good prior knowledge about the parameters of this matrix. The authors show that the use of a proper prior for the rate matrix parameters together with the conditional reference prior for the elapsed time yields a proper posterior distribution. The authors also demonstrate that, when compared to analyses based on priors previously proposed in the literature, a Bayesian analysis on the elapsed time based on the conditional reference prior possesses better frequentist properties. The type of prior thus represents a better default prior choice for estimation software.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Ferreira","given":"Marco A.

  {"id":"ferreira2021CoVizuRapidAnalysis","abstract":"Phylogenetics has played a pivotal role in the genomic epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, such as tracking the emergence and global spread of variants and scientific communication. However, the rapid accumulation of genomic data from around the world—with over two million genomes currently available in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data database—is testing the limits of standard phylogenetic methods. Here, we describe a new approach to rapidly analyze and visualize large numbers of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Using Python, genomes are filtered for problematic sites, incomplete coverage, and excessive divergence from a strict molecular clock. All differences from the reference genome, including indels, are extracted using minimap2 and compactly stored as a set of features for each genome. For each Pango lineage (https://cov-lineages.org), we collapse genomes with identical features into ‘variants’, generate 100 bootstrap samples of the feature set union to generate weights, and compute the symmetric differences between the weighted feature sets for every pair of variants. The resulting distance matrices are used to generate neighbor-joining trees in RapidNJ that are converted into a majority-rule consensus tree for each lineage. Branches with support values below 50 per cent or mean lengths below 0.5 differences are collapsed, and tip labels on affected branches are mapped to internal nodes as directly sampled ancestral variants. Currently, we process about 2 million genomes in approximately 9 h on 52 cores. The resulting trees are visualized using the JavaScript framework D3.js as ‘beadplots’, in which variants are represented by horizontal line segments, annotated with beads representing samples by collection date. Variants are linked by vertical edges to represent branches in the consensus tree. These visualizations are published at https://filogeneti.ca/CoVizu.

The SARS-CoV-2 genome is constituted of 29,903 base pairs, that code for four structural proteins (N, M, S, and E) and more than 20 non-structural proteins. Mutations in any of these regions, especially in those that encode for the structural proteins, have allowed the identification of diverse lineages around the world, some of them named as Variants of Concern (VOC) and Variants of Interest (VOI), according to the WHO and CDC. In this study, by using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology, we sequenced the SARS-CoV-2 genome of 422 samples from Colombian residents, all of them collected between April 2020 and January 2021. We obtained genetic information from 386 samples, leading us to the identification of 14 new lineages circulating in Colombia, 13 of which were identified for the first time in South America. GH was the predominant GISAID clade in our sample. Most mutations were either missense (53.6%) or synonymous mutations (37.4%), and most genetic changes were located in the ORF1ab gene (63.9%), followed by the S gene (12.9%). In the latter, we identified mutations E484K, L18F, and D614G. Recent evidence suggests that these mutations concede important particularities to the virus, compromising host immunity, the diagnostic test performance, and the effectiveness of some vaccines. Some important lineages containing these mutations are the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma (WHO Label).

  {"id":"gamble2020BioarchaeologyUrbanizationDenmark","abstract":"The medieval period in Denmark saw increasing urbanization with the development of more heavily structured towns focused around market centers. This was influenced by de-population in the mid-fourteenth century leading to socioeconomic and political restructuring. It has been suggested that these changes would have influenced population health, with disparities between rural and urban contexts, although bioarchaeological studies have thus far revealed inconsistent patterns. Using a microscopic approach to examine enamel developmental defects alongside mortality profiles, this research examines population differences in health and stress for urban and rural sites in and around the town of Horsens. The sample encompasses a rural site that went out of use by the mid-fourteenth century (Tirup), another rural site that saw continued use into the sixteenth century (Sejet), and an urban site that was contemporary with Sejet (Ole Wormsgade). The findings suggest site differences in mortality and early life stress, with some temporal patterning. The population at Tirup experienced more stress and reduced survivorship in the younger segment of the population. Temporal changes at the other two sites suggest a decrease in survivorship in the period from AD 1250 to AD 1350, with an increase in survivorship in the subsequent period (AD 1350–1400). Individuals at Sejet also experienced stress earlier in childhood than those at Ole Wormsgade, but the mortality patterns are similar between the two sites. This speaks to the complex nature of urbanization in this period in Denmark and provides insight into how populations respond to stress while experiencing a slow rate of urbanization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Gamble","given":"Julia A."}],"citation-key":"gamble2020BioarchaeologyUrbanizationDenmark","collection-title":"Bioarchaeology and Social Theory","container-title":"The Bioarchaeology of Urbanization: The Biological, Demographic, and Social Consequences of Living in Cities","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-53417-2_8","editor":[{"family":"Betsinger","given":"Tracy K."},{"family":"DeWitte","given":"Sharon N."}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-030-53417-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","page":"183-221","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"The Bioarchaeology of Urbanization in Denmark","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-53417-2_8"},

Through this we offer an alternative hypothesis for the history and evolution of the treponemal diseases, and posit that yaws be considered an important contributor to the sudden epidemic of late 15th century Europe that is widely ascribed to syphilis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Giffin","given":"Karen"},{"family":"Lankapalli","given":"Aditya Kumar"},{"family":"Sabin","given":"Susanna"},{"family":"Spyrou","given":"Maria A."},{"family":"Posth","given":"Cosimo"},{"family":"Kozakaitė","given":"Justina"},{"family":"Friedrich","given":"Ronny"},{"family":"Miliauskienė","given":"Žydrūnė"},{"family":"Jankauskas","given":"Rimantas"},{"family":"Herbig","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Bos","given":"Kirsten I."}],"citation-key":"giffin2020TreponemalGenomeHistoric","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-020-66012-x","ISSN":"2045-2322","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,11]]},"PMCID":"PMC7290034","PMID":"32528126","source":"PubMed Central","title":"A treponemal genome from an historic plague victim supports a recent emergence of yaws and its presence in 15th century Europe","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7290034/","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"gilbert2004AbsenceYersiniaPestisspecific","abstract":"This study reports the results of a collaborative study undertaken by two independent research groups to (a) confirm recent PCR-based detection of Yersinia pestis DNA in human teeth from medieval plague victims in France, and (b) to extend these observations over five different European burial sites believed to contain plague victims dating from the late 13th to 17th centuries. Several different sets of primers were used, including those previously documented to yield positive results on ancient DNA extracts. No Y. pestis DNA could be amplified from DNA extracted from 108 teeth belonging to 61 individuals, despite the amplification of numerous other bacterial DNA sequences. Several methods of extracting dentine prior to the DNA extraction were also compared. PCR for bacterial 16S rDNA indicated the presence of multiple bacterial species in 23 out of 27 teeth DNA extracts where dentine was extracted using previously described methods. In comparison, positive results were obtained from only five out of 44 teeth DNA extracts for which a novel contamination-minimizing embedding technique was used. Therefore, high levels of environmental bacterial DNA are present in DNA extracts where previously described methods of tooth manipulation are used. To conclude, the absence of Y. pestis-specific DNA in an exhaustive search using specimens from multiple putative European plague burial sites does not allow us to confirm the identification of Y. pestis as the aetiological agent of the Black Death and subsequent plagues. In addition, the utility of the published tooth-based ancient DNA technique used to diagnose fatal bacteraemias in historical epidemics still awaits independent corroboration.,","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Gilbert","given":"M.

  {"id":"green2018PuttingAfricaBlack","abstract":"Did the Black Death, the famous, devastating plague pandemic that struck the Mediterranean and Western Europe in the mid-14th century and seeded new strains of the pathogen, Yersinia pestis, in new locales, also reach Sub-Saharan Africa? That it reached the Islamic North African littoral has never been in question: there is ample testimony from Arabic documentary sources for its devastating effects from Egypt to the Maghreb. But did it stop there? Archaeologists now have reason to believe that there was widespread abandonment of urban communities in West Africa in the 14th or 15th centuries. Focusing on the other side of the continent, the present essay argues that previously unutilized evidence—a “living archive” of genetic data combined with a new reading of linguistic and documentary evidence from the 14th through 20th centuries—suggests that plague did have a significant impact on pre-modern East Africa. The strains of Y. pestis currently found in East and Central Africa derive from one of the lineages involved in late medieval outbreaks in Central Eurasia. This post-Black Death strain, it is argued here, entered the continent most likely in the late 15th or early 16th century. This coincides with hitherto unexplained population migrations and other cultural signs of reactions to a deadly emerging disease. Although no aDNA (historical genetic material) for Y. pestis has yet been recovered from late medieval or early modern Africa, the present essay suggests that evidence for Y. pestis’s evolution and transcontinental movements, even those outside of Africa, can help archaeologists and historians draw Africa more centrally into the narratives of global history.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Green","given":"Monica H."}],"citation-key":"green2018PuttingAfricaBlack","container-title":"Afriques","DOI":"10.4000/afriques.2125","ISSN":"2108-6796","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","number":"09","publisher":"Institut des mondes africains (IMAF","source":"journals.openedition.org","title":"Putting Africa on the Black Death map: narratives from genetics and history","title-short":"Putting Africa on the Black Death map","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.4000/afriques.2125","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"green2020FourBlackDeaths","abstract":"The Black Death, often called the largest pandemic in human history, is conventionally defined as the massive plague outbreak of 1346 to 1353 c.e. that struck the Black Sea and Mediterranean, extended into the Middle East, North Africa, and western Europe, and killed as much as half the total population of those regions. Yet genetic approaches to plague’s history have established that Yersinia pestis, the causative organism of plague, suddenly diverged in Central Asia at some point before the Black Death, splitting into four new branches—a divergence geneticists have called the “Big Bang.” Drawing on a “biological archive” of genetic evidence, I trace the bacterial descendants of the Big Bang proliferation, comparing that data to historical human activities in and around the area of plague’s emergence. The Mongols, whose empire emerged in 1206, unwittingly moved plague through Central Eurasia in the thirteenth, not the fourteenth, century. Grain shipments that the Mongols brought with them to several sieges, including the siege of Baghdad, were the most likely mechanism of transmission. The fourteenth century plague outbreaks represent local spillover events out of the new plague reservoirs seeded by the military campaigns of the thirteenth century.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Green","given":"Monica H."}],"citation-key":"green2020FourBlackDeaths","container-title":"The American Historical Review","container-title-short":"The American Historical Review","DOI":"10.1093/ahr/rhaa511","ISSN":"0002-8762","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,29]]},"page":"1601-1631","source":"Silverchair","title":"The four Black Deaths","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ahr/rhaa511","volume":"125"},

  {"id":"greenlon2019GloballevelPopulationGenomics","abstract":"Although microorganisms are known to dominate Earth’s biospheres and drive biogeochemical cycling, little is known about the geographic distributions of microbial populations or the environmental factors that pattern those distributions. We used a global-level hierarchical sampling scheme to comprehensively characterize the evolutionary relationships and distributional limitations of the nitrogen-fixing bacterial symbionts of the crop chickpea, generating 1,027 draft whole-genome sequences at the level of bacterial populations, including 14 high-quality PacBio genomes from a phylogenetically representative subset. We find that diverse Mesorhizobium taxa perform symbiosis with chickpea and have largely overlapping global distributions. However, sampled locations cluster based on the phylogenetic diversity of Mesorhizobium populations, and diversity clusters correspond to edaphic and environmental factors, primarily soil type and latitude. Despite long-standing evolutionary divergence and geographic isolation, the diverse taxa observed to nodulate chickpea share a set of integrative conjugative elements (ICEs) that encode the major functions of the symbiosis. This symbiosis ICE takes 2 forms in the bacterial chromosome—tripartite and monopartite—with tripartite ICEs confined to a broadly distributed superspecies clade. The pairwise evolutionary relatedness of these elements is controlled as much by geographic distance as by the evolutionary relatedness of the background genome. In contrast, diversity in the broader gene content of Mesorhizobium genomes follows a tight linear relationship with core genome phylogenetic distance, with little detectable effect of geography. These results illustrate how geography and demography can operate differentially on the evolution of bacterial genomes and offer useful insights for the development of improved technologies for sustainable agriculture.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Greenlon","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Peter L."},{"family":"Damtew","given":"Zehara Mohammed"},{"family":"Muleta","given":"Atsede"},{"family":"Carrasquilla-Garcia","given":"Noelia"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Donghyun"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Hien P."},{"family":"Suryawanshi","given":"Vasantika"},{"family":"Krieg","given":"Christopher P."},{"family":"Yadav","given":"Sudheer Kumar"},{"family":"Patel","given":"Jai Singh"},{"family":"Mukherjee","given":"Arpan"},{"family":"Udupa","given":"Sripada"},{"family":"Benjelloun","given":"Imane"},{"family":"Thami-Alami","given":"Imane"},{"family":"Yasin","given":"Mohammad"},{"family":"Patil","given":"Bhuvaneshwara"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Sarvjeet"},{"family":"Sarma","given":"Birinchi Kumar"},{"family":"Wettberg","given":"Eric J.

Using a multidisciplinary approach, combining genomic and historical data, we assembled Y. pestis genomes from nine individuals covering four Eurasian sites and placed them into an historical context within the established phylogeny. CHE1 (Chechnya, Russia, 18th century) is now the latest Second Plague Pandemic genome and the first non-European sample in the post-Black Death lineage. Its placement in the phylogeny and our synthesis point toward the existence of an extra-European reservoir feeding plague into Western Europe in multiple waves.

Although there is much speculation on the etiology of the Colonial epidemics, direct evidence for the presence of specific viruses during the Colonial era is lacking. To uncover the diversity of viral pathogens during this period, we designed an enrichment assay targeting ancient DNA (aDNA) from viruses of clinical importance and applied it to DNA extracts from individuals found in a Colonial hospital and a Colonial chapel (16th–18th century) where records suggest that victims of epidemics were buried during important outbreaks in Mexico City. This allowed us to reconstruct three ancient human parvovirus B19 genomes and one ancient human hepatitis B virus genome from distinct individuals. The viral genomes are similar to African strains, consistent with the inferred morphological and genetic African ancestry of the hosts as well as with the isotopic analysis of the human remains, suggesting an origin on the African continent. This study provides direct molecular evidence of ancient viruses being transported to the Americas during the transatlantic slave trade and their subsequent introduction to New Spain.

  {"id":"ho2005TimeDependencyMolecular","abstract":"Studies of molecular evolutionary rates have yielded a wide range of rate estimates for various genes and taxa. Recent studies based on population-level and pedigree data have produced remarkably high estimates of mutation rate, which strongly contrast with substitution rates inferred in phylogenetic (species-level) studies. Using Bayesian analysis with a relaxed-clock model, we estimated rates for three groups of mitochondrial data: avian protein-coding genes, primate protein-coding genes, and primate d-loop sequences. In all three cases, we found a measurable transition between the high, short-term (&lt;1–2 Myr) mutation rate and the low, long-term substitution rate. The relationship between the age of the calibration and the rate of change can be described by a vertically translated exponential decay curve, which may be used for correcting molecular date estimates. The phylogenetic substitution rates in mitochondria are approximately 0.5% per million years for avian protein-coding sequences and 1.5% per million years for primate protein-coding and d-loop sequences. Further analyses showed that purifying selection offers the most convincing explanation for the observed relationship between the estimated rate and the depth of the calibration. We rule out the possibility that it is a spurious result arising from sequence errors, and find it unlikely that the apparent decline in rates over time is caused by mutational saturation. Using a rate curve estimated from the d-loop data, several dates for last common ancestors were calculated: modern humans and Neandertals (354 ka; 222–705 ka), Neandertals (108 ka; 70–156 ka), and modern humans (76 ka; 47–110 ka). If the rate curve for a particular taxonomic group can be accurately estimated, it can be a useful tool for correcting divergence date estimates by taking the rate decay into account. Our results show that it is invalid to extrapolate molecular rates of change across different evolutionary timescales, which has important consequences for studies of populations, domestication, conservation genetics, and human evolution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Ho","given":"Simon Y.

  {"id":"ho2009AccountingCalibrationUncertainty","abstract":"The estimation of phylogenetic divergence times from sequence data is an important component of many molecular evolutionary studies. There is now a general appreciation that the procedure of divergence dating is considerably more complex than that initially described in the 1960s by Zuckerkandl and Pauling (1962, 1965). In particular, there has been much critical attention toward the assumption of a global molecular clock, resulting in the development of increasingly sophisticated techniques for inferring divergence times from sequence data. In response to the documentation of widespread departures from clocklike behavior, a variety of local- and relaxed-clock methods have been proposed and implemented. Local-clock methods permit different molecular clocks in different parts of the phylogenetic tree, thereby retaining the advantages of the classical molecular clock while casting off the restrictive assumption of a single, global rate of substitution (Rambaut and Bromham 1998; Yoder and Yang 2000).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Ho","given":"Simon Y.

  {"id":"hu2016OriginsCurrentSeventh","abstract":"Vibrio cholerae has caused seven cholera pandemics since 1817, imposing terror on much of the world, but bacterial strains are currently only available for the sixth and seventh pandemics. The El Tor biotype seventh pandemic began in 1961 in Indonesia, but did not originate directly from the classical biotype sixth-pandemic strain. Previous studies focused mainly on the spread of the seventh pandemic after 1970. Here, we analyze in unprecedented detail the origin, evolution, and transition to pandemicity of the seventh-pandemic strain. We used high-resolution comparative genomic analysis of strains collected from 1930 to 1964, covering the evolution from the first available El Tor biotype strain to the start of the seventh pandemic. We define six stages leading to the pandemic strain and reveal all key events. The seventh pandemic originated from a nonpathogenic strain in the Middle East, first observed in 1897. It subsequently underwent explosive diversification, including the spawning of the pandemic lineage. This rapid diversification suggests that, when first observed, the strain had only recently arrived in the Middle East, possibly from the Asian homeland of cholera. The lineage migrated to Makassar, Indonesia, where it gained the important virulence-associated elements Vibrio seventh pandemic island I (VSP-I), VSP-II, and El Tor type cholera toxin prophage by 1954, and it then became pandemic in 1961 after only 12 additional mutations. Our data indicate that specific niches in the Middle East and Makassar were important in generating the pandemic strain by providing gene sources and the driving forces for genetic events.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Hu","given":"Dalong"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Bin"},{"family":"Feng","given":"Lu"},{"family":"Ding","given":"Peng"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Xi"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Min"},{"family":"Cao","given":"Boyang"},{"family":"Reeves","given":"Peter R."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Lei"}],"citation-key":"hu2016OriginsCurrentSeventh","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1608732113","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"48","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,11,29]]},"language":"en","page":"E7730-E7739","PMID":"27849586","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"PNAS Plus","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Origins of the current seventh cholera pandemic","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/113/48/E7730","volume":"113"},
  {"id":"hufthammer2013RatsCannotHave","abstract":"The commonly accepted understanding of modern human plague epidemics has been that plague is a disease of rodents that is transmitted to humans from black rats, with rat fleas as vectors. Historians have assumed that this transmission model is also valid for the Black Death and later medieval plague epidemics in Europe. Here we examine information on the geographical distribution and population density of the black rat (Rattus rattus) in Norway and other Nordic countries in medieval times. The study is based on older zoological literature and on bone samples from archaeological excavations. Only a few of the archaeological finds from medieval harbour towns in Norway contain rat bones. There are no finds of black rats from the many archaeological excavations in rural areas or from the inland town of Hamar. These results show that it is extremely unlikely that rats accounted for the spread of plague to rural areas in Norway. Archaeological evidence from other Nordic countries indicates that rats were uncommon there too, and were therefore unlikely to be responsible for the dissemination of human plague. We hypothesize that the mode of transmission during the historical plague epidemics was from human to human via an insect ectoparasite vector.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Hufthammer","given":"Anne Karin"},{"family":"Walløe","given":"Lars"}],"citation-key":"hufthammer2013RatsCannotHave","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2012.12.007","ISSN":"0305-4403","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1752-1759","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Rats cannot have been intermediate hosts for <i>Yersinia pestis</i> during medieval plague epidemics in Northern Europe","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440312005286","volume":"40"},

A popular model in continuous phylogeography—with location data provided in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates—describes spread as a Brownian motion (Brownian Motion Phylogeography, BMP) in continuous space and time, akin to similar models of continuous trait evolution. Here, we show that reconstructions using this model can be strongly affected by sampling biases, such as the lack of sampling from certain areas. As an attempt to reduce the effects of sampling bias on BMP, we consider the addition of sequence-free samples from under-sampled areas. While this approach alleviates the effects of sampling bias, in most scenarios this will not be a viable option due to the need for prior knowledge of an outbreak’s spatial distribution. We therefore consider an alternative model, the spatial Λ-Fleming-Viot process (ΛFV), which has recently gained popularity in population genetics. Despite the ΛFV’s robustness to sampling biases, we find that the different assumptions of the ΛFV and BMP models result in different applicabilities, with the ΛFV being more appropriate for scenarios of endemic spread, and BMP being more appropriate for recent outbreaks or colonizations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Kalkauskas","given":"Antanas"},{"family":"Perron","given":"Umberto"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Yuxuan"},{"family":"Goldman","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Baele","given":"Guy"},{"family":"Guindon","given":"Stephane"},{"family":"Maio","given":"Nicola De"}],"citation-key":"kalkauskas2021SamplingBiasModel","container-title":"PLOS Computational Biology","container-title-short":"PLOS Computational Biology","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008561","ISSN":"1553-7358","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,6]]},"language":"en","page":"e1008561","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Sampling bias and model choice in continuous phylogeography: getting lost on a random walk","title-short":"Sampling bias and model choice in continuous phylogeography","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008561","volume":"17"},

  {"id":"kazak2016BrucellosisRetrospectiveEvaluation","abstract":"INTRODUCTION Brucellosis is a public health problem that is prevalent in several developing countries.\nMETHODS The clinical and laboratory characteristics of 164 cases of brucellosis in Bursa, Turkey, were retrospectively evaluated.\nRESULTS The ages of the 164 patients ranged from 15–85 years. All of the patients underwent the Rose Bengal test and 163 (99.4%) patients tested positive. 122 (74.4%) patients were diagnosed with acute brucellosis, 31 (18.9%) with subacute brucellosis and 11 (6.7%) with chronic brucellosis. Focal involvement was found in 101 (61.6%) patients. Although patients with focal involvement had a higher white blood cell count (p = 0.002), those without focal involvement had higher aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase values, and lower platelet values (p = 0.005, 0.007 and 0.039, respectively). Spondylodiscitis was observed on imaging in 58 (66.7%) of the 87 patients who presented with back pain. Among the 118 patients who were examined within the first month of treatment, 79 (66.9%) responded to treatment. The relapse rate was 11.6% among all 164 patients.\nCONCLUSION Brucellosis should be considered as a differential diagnosis among patients who present with fever, and joint or back pain. Focal involvement should be investigated in the presence of leucocytosis, and subacute or chronic forms of brucellosis. To identify cases of spondylodiscitis, radiography should be performed in patients who present with back pain.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Kazak","given":"E"},{"family":"Akalın","given":"H"},{"family":"Yılmaz","given":"E"},{"family":"Heper","given":"Y"},{"family":"Mıstık","given":"R"},{"family":"Sınırtaş","given":"M"},{"family":"Özakın","given":"C"},{"family":"Göral","given":"G"},{"family":"Helvacı","given":"S"}],"citation-key":"kazak2016BrucellosisRetrospectiveEvaluation","container-title":"Singapore Medical Journal","DOI":"10.11622/smedj.2015163","ISSN":"00375675","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,11]]},"language":"en","page":"624-629","source":"Crossref","title":"Brucellosis: a retrospective evaluation of 164 cases","title-short":"Brucellosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.smj.org.sg/article/brucellosis-retrospective-evaluation-164-cases","volume":"57"},

  {"id":"kelmelis2021UrbanRuralSurvivorship","abstract":"Research on the survival of people in Pre- and Post-Black Death London revealed declines in survival prior to the epidemic, and improvements in survival afterwards. This study expands upon previous research by examining whether these trends are also observed in medieval Danish populations. Analyses were done using a sample of 877 individuals excavated from six cemeteries from urban and rural sites in medieval Denmark (c. AD 1050-1536), which includes individuals who were buried within three temporal periods based on relative dating from arm position in the grave: pre-Black Death (c. AD 1050-1250), epidemic years that include the Black Death and preceding famine years (c. AD 1250-1400), and post-Black Death (c. AD 1400-1536) years. Temporal trends in survivorship were assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Survival analyses were also used to examine the effect of urbanization on survivorship over time. Fertility proxies were estimated to control for changes in birth rates in the interpretation of our results. The results indicate a general increase in survival after the Black Death, especially for nonadults (Mantel-Cox p = 0.10) in the absence of a fertility effect. Urban dwellers experienced significant improvements in survivorship after the Black Death (p = 0.04). Analysis of Pre-Black Death survivorship reveals elevated survival for rural adults and urban nonadults, indicating that urban environments may have been more detrimental to adults than nonadults before the epidemic. These results are consistent with previous findings from London, demonstrating that survival and mortality were significantly different between the periods leading up to and after the plague, and there were differential risks for adults and nonadults in urban and rural settings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Kelmelis","given":"Saige"},{"family":"DeWitte","given":"Sharon N."}],"citation-key":"kelmelis2021UrbanRuralSurvivorship","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2021.103089","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"103089","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Urban and rural survivorship in Pre- and Post-Black Death Denmark","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X21003011","volume":"38"},

These formulae are applied to estimate the base substitution rates at the first, second, and third positions of codons in genes for presomatotropins, preproinsulins, and alpha- and beta-globins (using comparisons involving mammals). Also, formulae for estimating the synonymous component (at the third codon position) and the standard errors are obtained.

A widely used multiplexing strategy for the Illumina Genome Analyzer utilizes sample-specific indexes, which are embedded in one of the library adapters. However, this and similar multiplex approaches come with a risk of sample misidentification. By introducing indexes into both library adapters (double indexing), we have developed a method that reveals the rate of sample misidentification within current multiplex sequencing experiments. With $0.3% these rates are orders of magnitude higher than expected and may severely confound applications in cancer genomics and other fields requiring accurate detection of rare variants. We identified the occurrence of mixed clusters on the flow as the predominant source of error. The accuracy of sample identification is further impaired if indexed oligonucleotides are cross-contaminated or if indexed libraries are amplified in bulk.

  {"id":"kluge2018WatchdogWorkflowManagement","abstract":"Background: The development of high-throughput experimental technologies, such as next-generation sequencing, have led to new challenges for handling, analyzing and integrating the resulting large and diverse datasets. Bioinformatical analysis of these data commonly requires a number of mutually dependent steps applied to numerous samples for multiple conditions and replicates. To support these analyses, a number of workflow management systems (WMSs) have been developed to allow automated execution of corresponding analysis workflows. Major advantages of WMSs are the easy reproducibility of results as well as the reusability of workflows or their components.\nResults: In this article, we present Watchdog, a WMS for the automated analysis of large-scale experimental data. Main features include straightforward processing of replicate data, support for distributed computer systems, customizable error detection and manual intervention into workflow execution. Watchdog is implemented in Java and thus platform-independent and allows easy sharing of workflows and corresponding program modules. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for workflow construction using pre-defined modules as well as a helper script for creating new module definitions. Execution of workflows is possible using either the GUI or a command-line interface and a web-interface is provided for monitoring the execution status and intervening in case of errors. To illustrate its potentials on a real-life example, a comprehensive workflow and modules for the analysis of RNA-seq experiments were implemented and are provided with the software in addition to simple test examples.\nConclusions: Watchdog is a powerful and flexible WMS for the analysis of large-scale high-throughput experiments. We believe it will greatly benefit both users with and without programming skills who want to develop and apply bioinformatical workflows with reasonable overhead.

There is a substantial amount of historical and modern primary and secondary literature about the spatial and temporal extent of epidemics, circumstances of transmission or symptoms and treatments. Many quantitative analyses rely on structured data, but the extraction of specific information such as the time and place of outbreaks is a tedious process. Machine learning algorithms for natural language processing (NLP) can potentially facilitate the establishment of datasets, but their use in plague research has not been explored much yet. We investigated the performance of five pre-trained NLP libraries (Google NLP, Stanford CoreNLP, spaCy, germaNER and Geoparser.io) for the extraction of location data from a German plague treatise published in 1908 compared to the gold standard of manual annotation. Of all tested algorithms, we found that Stanford CoreNLP had the best overall performance but spaCy showed the highest sensitivity. Moreover, we demonstrate how word associations can be extracted and displayed with simple text mining techniques in order to gain a quick insight into salient topics. Finally, we compared our newly digitised plague dataset to a re-digitised version of the famous Biraben plague list and update the spatio-temporal extent of the second pandemic plague mentions. We conclude that all NLP tools have their limitations, but they are potentially useful to accelerate the collection of data and the generation of a global plague outbreak database.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Krauer","given":"Fabienne"},{"family":"Schmid","given":"Boris V."}],"citation-key":"krauer2021MappingPlagueNatural","container-title":"medRxiv","DOI":"10.1101/2021.04.27.21256212","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,30]]},"language":"en","page":"2021.04.27.21256212","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press","source":"www.medrxiv.org","title":"Mapping the plague through natural language processing","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.27.21256212v1"},

Three distinct eras can be identified on the basis of the frequency, nature, and geographic distribution of cases. During 1900–1925, outbreaks were common but were restricted to populous port cities. During 1926–1964, the geographic range of disease expanded rapidly, while the total number of reported cases fell. During 1965–2012, sporadic cases occurred annually, primarily in the rural Southwest. Clinical and demographic features of human illness have shifted over time as the disease has moved from crowded cities to the rural West. These shifts reflect changes in the populations at risk, the advent of antibiotics, and improved detection of more clinically indistinct forms of infection.

These analyses are strongly guided by the input of an epidemiological model as well as sequence data that must contain sufficient intersequence variability in order to be informative. These criteria, however, may not be met during the early stages of an outbreak. Here we investigate the impact of low diversity sequence data on phylodynamic inference using the birth&ndash;death and coalescent exponential models. Through our simulation study, estimating the molecular evolutionary rate required enough sequence diversity and is an essential first step for any phylodynamic inference. Following this, the birth&ndash;death model outperforms the coalescent exponential model in estimating epidemiological parameters, when faced with low diversity sequence data due to explicitly exploiting the sampling times. In contrast, the coalescent model requires additional samples and therefore variability in sequence data before accurate estimates can be obtained. These findings were also supported through our empirical data analyses of an Australian and a New Zealand cluster outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, the birth&ndash;death model is more robust when applied to datasets with low sequence diversity given sampling is specified and this should be considered for future viral outbreak investigations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Lam","given":"Anthony"},{"family":"Duchene","given":"Sebastian"}],"citation-key":"lam2021ImpactsLowDiversity","container-title":"Viruses","DOI":"10.3390/v13010079","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"79","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"The impacts of low diversity sequence data on phylodynamic inference during an emerging epidemic","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/13/1/79","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"laudisoit2009DIVERSITYECOLOGYSTATUS","abstract":"In the Lushoto plague focus, Tanzania, plague - caused by the gramnegative bacterium Yersinia pestis - has been endemic for many years. In 1980, plague emerged in two villages and subsequently spread to more than 50 villages in the following years. Between 1980 and 2004 - when the last cases were reported - 7603 people had been infected by the disease, mostly of the bubonic flea-driven type. During this period, rodent and flea control measures were taken, medical staff trained, a community education program on risks of plague initiated and a Permanent Plague Control Team (PPCT) created and functional. However, plague was never isolated by direct culture from any small mammal species during the 16 years epidemiological monitoring of the region; only positive serology indicated that the plague bacterium circulated among wild rodents. Nonetheless, plague came back twice a year, usually during the rainy seasons. Indeed, until 2004, in spite of rodent and flea management campaigns, plague reappeared in October/November and May/June. Even though plague re-emergence seems linked with climatic factors to some extent, the number of plague cases is prone to an extreme interanual and interlocality variation and seems unpredictable.\nHowever, during these last four years research, no plague cases were reported to the health authorities in the district; neither rodents, nor fleas were found positive for plague and none of the above listed factors seemed to contribute alone to the observed plague pattern. Indeed, despite 20 years of epidemiological and ecological research, the relations between the biotic and abiotic factors that favour plague maintenance, and which account for the observed seasonal and spatial distribution of the human cases are still poorly understood. One major reason - non exclusive and clearly understandable - to\nthis gap of knowledge is, to some extent, due to the methodology.Indeed, the emergency response during epidemics and the lack of systematic\ncomparison between the potential hosts and vectors of plague in plagueendemic\nand plague-free locations, especially before and after human\nepidemics, does not grant a solid base for a global comprehension of the plague\ncycle dynamics in the long run. Due to obvious financial constraints, rodent and\nflea surveys always occurred during (or shortly after) human epidemics, mostly\nin the domestic and peri-domestic environments. However, times of epidemics\nor epizootics are not suitable to identify the true reservoir of the plague\nbacillus. Indeed, during epizootics, the circulation of the plague bacillus is\nexpected in a large variety of mammals since the probability that many\ndifferent species will have been exposed is real, and hence is likely to hide the\ntrue reservoir of the disease.\nOn the other hand, during inter-epidemics and inter-epizootics, the chances are\nlimited to find out the reservoir since firstly, no geographical information allows\nfor the localization of resistant mammals that might be confined to a small area,\nand second their populations might either be dispersed or less abundant.\nConsequently, the lack of evidence of the presence of the plague bacillus or\nevidence of it circulating in the area does not mean that plague has totally\ndisappeared from the area and, as much the true reservoir of the disease as\nwell as the place – outside the domestic environment - where humans acquire\nthe infection remain unknown. The temporary absence or quiescence of Yersinia\npestis in Lushoto, and in other endemic foci, is a typical feature of current\nplague foci that suggests that other yet unknown or under-estimated\nparameters linked with the different elements of the natural plague cycle might\nplay an important role in the long term maintenance of the bacteria locally.\nThose parameters might be related to the population dynamics of resistant and\nsusceptible host species, to their associated flea fauna and their seasonal and\nspatial dynamics, to the vectorial capacity of fleas, to sociocultural factors, to\ninteractions with other sympatric/syntopic bacteria and to the involvement of\nsoil as a biotic reservoir among others.Those factors, and others, are discussed in this dissertation and further\nhighlight how much the classical natural plague cycle might be more complex\nthan historically described, opening new perspectives of research that involve\nsoil microorganisms as intermediate hosts.\nIn 2005, this study was initiated with the main objective of identifying the small\nmammal and flea species potentially involved in the plague cycle by comparing\nthese animal communities in 2 plague-endemic and 2 neighbouring plague-free\nlocations in order to better understand the ecology of the disease which would\n– in terms - facilitate the introduction of sustainable strategies for prevention of\noutbreaks and plague control in case they occur. The secondary objectives\nunderlying this research were first to identify those small mammal and flea\nspecies that were only found in plague endemic-locations compared to plaguefree\nlocations, second to monitor plague prevalence (direct and indirect or\nserological prevalence) and third to investigate the seasonal and spatial\npopulation dynamics of the domestic and wild (or sylvatic) small mammal\npopulations. Small mammals were regularly trapped in various habitats (crop\nfield, natural forest, bushes, shrubs and houses) by using different kinds of live\ntraps while domestic fleas were collected using kerosene lamps hung at night in\nthe typical mud houses of the area. In the course of 2006, eight additional\nvillages (3 plague-free and 5 plague-endemic locations) were included in the\ndomestic flea study since preliminary results pointed towards a potential role of\nthe human flea Pulex irritans in plague epidemiology. The socio-cultural issues\nwere also examined by questionnaire targeting household composition, sleeping\nhabits, cattle husbandry, rat and flea nuisance, daily activities and agricultural\npractices.\nThe major results are presented in seven manuscripts that are split in sections :\nthe domestic plague cycle and the sylvatic plague cycle. In the first section, we\nshow that Pulex irritans, the human flea, is the predominant flea species\n(72.4%) in houses of the Lushoto district.Other species collected were Echidnophaga gallinacea (15.1%),\nCtenocephalides felis and C. canis (6.5%), Xenopsylla brasiliensis (3.4%), and\nTunga penetrans (2.6%). We show that twice as many houses were infested by\nP. irritans in high plague frequency villages than in low plague frequency\nvillages. For all the trapping sessions in 2005 and 2006, the P. irritans index\n(Pii) was indeed 2-9 times greater in plague endemic locations than in plague\nfree locations. While a mere – but strongly positive - correlation was\nestablished between the current P. irritans index and the plague frequency and\nincidence (log transformed) calculated on the past 16 years epidemiological\ndata, these observations suggest that in Lushoto district human fleas may play\na role in plague epidemiology. In another active plague focus of Eastern Africa,\nthe Ituri plague focus (DRCongo), none of the domestic fleas analyzed\n(782/2432) were pestiferous 6 months after an important epidemic outbreak\nhaving involved more than 600 suspected cases. The fleas did however carry\nother flea- and rodent-borne zoonotic pathogens, namely Bartonella vinsonii, B.\nclarridgeiae, B. rochalimae and Rickettsia felis with an estimated infection rate\nfor R. felis of 10.72% and for Bartonella spp. of 3.66%. This is significant in the\nview that co-infection might play a role in sensitizing rodents and/or humans to\nother diseases by lowering immune-defences in a population having an already\nfairly unbalanced diet. We also describe a new technique that might be useful in\ninterpreting flea host switching and how plague might be brought back from\nendemic pockets into the domestic environment by wild rodent fleas feeding on\nalternative domestic host. Indeed, we have developed a multiplexed, real-time\npolymerase chain reaction assay targeting mitochondrial genes that is capable\nof detecting blood meal sources in fleas collected off-host in East Africa. Future\napplication of the assay will help us better define the ecology of plague in East\nAfrica by providing valuable information regarding the potential flea hosts\npresent in and around human habitations which in combination with the PCRs\ntargeting specific pathogens fragments will allow us to estimate the level of\nhuman risk to flea or other vector borne diseases.During the exploration of the sylvatic cycle, we discovered two new flea species\nthat were combed off wild rodents and that add to the list of the potential\nplague vectors and carriers in the area, namely Ctenophthalmus\n(Ethioctenophthalmus) teucqae n.sp. and Ctenophthalmus\n(Ethioctenophthalmus) kemmelberg n. sp. A new subspecies, C.(E.) teucqae\nshumeensis n.ssp., was also determined following examination of collection\nand comparison specimen from the National History Museum of London. The\nsecond part of the sylvatic cycle section examines the small mammal and flea\ncommunities, their diversity, their ecological characteristics, their associations\nand dynamics in relation with habitat characteristics in general and in plague\nendemic (PEL) and plague free locations (PFL) in particular. Indeed, the\ncontinuous reappearance of the disease in some locations might be due to\nvariations in small mammals and fleas species composition, diversity and\nrelative abundances in plague-endemic and plague-free locations. In particular,\nthe plague pattern might be partly explained by the absence of one or several\npotential good reservoir(s) and/or vector(s) in plague free locations and the\npresence of such organisms in plague endemic locations. For these reasons in\nthis part, we first investigate the host and flea species diversity and\ncomposition across different habitats (crop fields, natural forest, plantations,\nopen and close shrubbery) during the dry and rainy seasons in the Lushoto\ndistrict. The paper shows that the only host and flea community parameters\naffected by either season or habitat type are host density and mean\ninfracommunity flea species richness (species diversity on a particular host\nspecies). In particular, host density was lowest in crop fields and natural forest,\nhigher in commercial plantations and open shrubbery, and highest in closed\nshrubbery. Host individuals harbored, on average, significantly more flea\nspecies during the dry season than during the rainy season. We also found that\nduring both seasons, the similarity in flea species composition increased with\nan increase in the similarity in host species composition.Ordination of habitats according to their host and flea species composition\ndemonstrated that the pattern of between-habitat similarity in both host and\nflea species composition varied seasonally. Moreover, despite the relatively rich\nmammal and flea fauna of the study region, the major contribution to variation\nin species composition between seasons and among habitats was due to a few\nspecies only. Indeed, seasonal differences in host species composition within a\nhabitat were mainly due to changes in relative abundance of Lophuromys\nkilonzoi, Grammomys sp. and Praomys delectorum. whereas seasonal\ndifferences in flea species composition were mainly due to changes in relative\nabundances of Nosopsyllus incisus, Ctenophthalmus eximius and Dinopsyllus\ngrypurus. Moreover, in different hosts, the main differences in species\ncomposition of flea assemblages were due to different flea species. In other\nwords, this confirms that flea dynamics is influenced by host diversity and\npopulation dynamics and abiotic factors of the off-host environment however\nthe former appears to explain variance in flea species composition between\nlocalities in the tropics better than between localities in temperate and arid\nzones. This analysis also suggests that some flea species are more opportunistic\nthan other, and that host switching is a frequent phenomenon influenced by\nhost population dynamics and habitat. In order to understand the reasons for\nthe geographic and seasonal reemergence of plague, we further characterized\nhost species by species richness and degree of taxonomic relatedness of its flea\nassemblages. In total, we included 1283 individual small mammals belonging to\n20 species from which 2809 individual fleas belonging to 24 species were\ncollected. We found no significant difference in either host density or any\nvariable related to flea abundance or diversity. However, there was a marginally\nsignificant effect of taxonomic distinctness of a flea assemblage harbored by a\nhost on its probability to be more abundant in either plague endemic or plaguefree\nlocations. Furthermore, hosts more abundant in plague-endemic locationstended to harbor closely-related fleas.\n- - 20 - -\nThe relative distribution of some flea species was seasonally opposite between\nplague-endemic and plague-free locations. In other words, a flea could be more\nabundant in plague-endemic locations during the dry season, but more\nabundant in plague-free locations during the rainy season and vice versa.\nFinally, while opportunistic and specialist fleas were equally distributed in both\nsets of locations, fleas exploiting distantly-related hosts were found mainly in\nplague-free locations during the rainy season. We suggest that the observed\npatterns might arise due to seasonal and spatial differences in local\nmicroclimatic conditions and landscape connectivity. Several other factors that\ncould play a role in plague maintenance, re-emergence or transmission were\nexamined by parallel research by master’s students. These included studies on\nland use patterns and soil composition (2005-2006), landscape connectivity\n(2006), climatic data collection (2007-2008), flea proventriculus morphology\nstructure (2007), and burrow flea collection (2008). However, these data show\nthat the biotic and abiotic factors - considered in this study - alone cannot\nexplain the human plague pattern in the Lushoto district and that other\ncomponents (especially soil physical and chemical properties, landscape\nconnectivity, land use pattern, subterranean ecosystems), their multiscale\ninteractions, and the dynamics of these metapopulation at a local and\nmicrolocal level have to be integrated in order to better understand plague\nmaintenance and reemergence.","author":[{"family":"Laudisoit","given":"Anne"}],"citation-key":"laudisoit2009DIVERSITYECOLOGYSTATUS","DOI":"10.13140/RG.2.2.25362.25281","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,11,24]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"DIVERSITY, ECOLOGY AND STATUS OF POTENTIAL HOSTS AND VECTORS OF THE PLAGUE BACILLUS YERSINIA PESTIS.

We detected clear signs of recombination within Y. pseudotuberculosis s.s. as well as imports from Y. similis and the Korean group. The sources of genetic diversification within Y. pseudotuberculosis s.s. were approximately equally divided between recombination and mutation, whereas recombination has not yet been demonstrated in Y. pestis, which is also much more genetically monomorphic than is Y. pseudotuberculosis s.s. Most Y. pseudotuberculosis s.s. belong to a diffuse group of sequence types lacking clear population structure, although this species contains a melibiose-negative clade that is present globally in domesticated animals. Yersinia similis corresponds to the previously identified Y. pseudotuberculosis genetic type G4, which is probably not pathogenic because it lacks the virulence factors that are typical for Y. pseudotuberculosis s.s. In contrast, Y. pseudotuberculosis s.s., the Korean group and Y. pestis can all cause disease in humans.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Laukkanen-Ninios","given":"Riikka"},{"family":"Didelot","given":"Xavier"},{"family":"Jolley","given":"Keith A."},{"family":"Morelli","given":"Giovanna"},{"family":"Sangal","given":"Vartul"},{"family":"Kristo","given":"Paula"},{"family":"Imori","given":"Priscilla F.

  {"id":"lee2015PopulationGenomicsMycobacterium","abstract":"Through an in-depth analysis of whole-genome sequencing data from Nunavik, Québec, we inferred the evolution of a single dominant strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Our analyses suggest that M. tuberculosis was first introduced into this region in the early 20th century. Since this time, M. tuberculosis has spread extensively, predominantly within but also between villages. Despite a genomic profile that lacks features of a hypervirulent strain, this strain has thrived in this region and continues to cause outbreaks. This suggests that successful clones of M. tuberculosis need not be inherently exceptional; host or social factors conducive to transmission may contribute to the ongoing tuberculosis epidemic in this and other high-incidence settings., Nunavik, Québec suffers from epidemic tuberculosis (TB), with an incidence 50-fold higher than the Canadian average. Molecular studies in this region have documented limited bacterial genetic diversity among Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates, consistent with a founder strain and/or ongoing spread. We have used whole-genome sequencing on 163 M. tuberculosis isolates from 11 geographically isolated villages to provide a high-resolution portrait of bacterial genetic diversity in this setting. All isolates were lineage 4 (Euro-American), with two sublineages present (major, n = 153; minor, n = 10). Among major sublineage isolates, there was a median of 46 pairwise single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) was in the early 20th century. Pairs of isolates within a village had significantly fewer SNPs than pairs from different villages (median: 6 vs. 47, P < 0.00005), indicating that most transmission occurs within villages. There was an excess of nonsynonymous SNPs after the diversification of M. tuberculosis within Nunavik: The ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS) was 0.534 before the MRCA but 0.777 subsequently (P = 0.010). Nonsynonymous SNPs were detected across all gene categories, arguing against positive selection and toward genetic drift with relaxation of purifying selection. Supporting the latter possibility, 28 genes were partially or completely deleted since the MRCA, including genes previously reported to be essential for M. tuberculosis growth. Our findings indicate that the epidemiologic success of M. tuberculosis in this region is more likely due to an environment conducive to TB transmission than a particularly well-adapted strain.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Robyn S."},{"family":"Radomski","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Proulx","given":"Jean-Francois"},{"family":"Levade","given":"Ines"},{"family":"Shapiro","given":"B.

  {"id":"lemey2009BayesianPhylogeographyFinds","abstract":"As a key factor in endemic and epidemic dynamics, the geographical distribution of viruses has been frequently interpreted in the light of their genetic histories. Unfortunately, inference of historical dispersal or migration patterns of viruses has mainly been restricted to model-free heuristic approaches that provide little insight into the temporal setting of the spatial dynamics. The introduction of probabilistic models of evolution, however, offers unique opportunities to engage in this statistical endeavor. Here we introduce a Bayesian framework for inference, visualization and hypothesis testing of phylogeographic history. By implementing character mapping in a Bayesian software that samples time-scaled phylogenies, we enable the reconstruction of timed viral dispersal patterns while accommodating phylogenetic uncertainty. Standard Markov model inference is extended with a stochastic search variable selection procedure that identifies the parsimonious descriptions of the diffusion process. In addition, we propose priors that can incorporate geographical sampling distributions or characterize alternative hypotheses about the spatial dynamics. To visualize the spatial and temporal information, we summarize inferences using virtual globe software. We describe how Bayesian phylogeography compares with previous parsimony analysis in the investigation of the influenza A H5N1 origin and H5N1 epidemiological linkage among sampling localities. Analysis of rabies in West African dog populations reveals how virus diffusion may enable endemic maintenance through continuous epidemic cycles. From these analyses, we conclude that our phylogeographic framework will make an important asset in molecular epidemiology that can be easily generalized to infer biogeogeography from genetic data for many organisms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Lemey","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Rambaut","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Drummond","given":"Alexei J."},{"family":"Suchard","given":"Marc A."}],"citation-key":"lemey2009BayesianPhylogeographyFinds","container-title":"PLOS Computational Biology","container-title-short":"PLOS Computational Biology","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000520","ISSN":"1553-7358","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,9,25]]},"language":"en","page":"e1000520","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Bayesian phylogeography finds its roots","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000520","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"li2009GenotypingPhylogeneticAnalysis","abstract":"Background The species Yersinia pestis is commonly divided into three classical biovars, Antiqua, Medievalis, and Orientalis, belonging to subspecies pestis pathogenic for human and the (atypical) non-human pathogenic biovar Microtus (alias Pestoides) including several non-pestis subspecies. Recent progress in molecular typing methods enables large-scale investigations in the population structure of this species. It is now possible to test hypotheses about its evolution which were proposed decades ago. For instance the three classical biovars of different geographical distributions were suggested to originate from Central Asia. Most investigations so far have focused on the typical pestis subspecies representatives found outside of China, whereas the understanding of the emergence of this human pathogen requires the investigation of strains belonging to subspecies pestis from China and to the Microtus biovar. Methodology/Principal Findings Multi-locus VNTR analysis (MLVA) with 25 loci was performed on a collection of Y. pestis isolates originating from the majority of the known foci worldwide and including typical rhamnose-negative subspecies pestis as well as rhamnose-positive subspecies pestis and biovar Microtus. More than 500 isolates from China, the Former Soviet Union (FSU), Mongolia and a number of other foci around the world were characterized and resolved into 350 different genotypes. The data revealed very close relationships existing between some isolates from widely separated foci as well as very high diversity which can conversely be observed between nearby foci. Conclusions/Significance The results obtained are in full agreement with the view that the Y. pestis subsp. pestis pathogenic for humans emerged in the Central Asia region between China, Kazakhstan, Russia and Mongolia, only three clones of which spread out of Central Asia. The relationships among the strains in China, Central Asia and the rest of the world based on the MLVA25 assay provide an unprecedented view on the expansion and microevolution of Y. pestis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Yanjun"},{"family":"Cui","given":"Yujun"},{"family":"Hauck","given":"Yolande"},{"family":"Platonov","given":"Mikhail E."},{"family":"Dai","given":"Erhei"},{"family":"Song","given":"Yajun"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Zhaobiao"},{"family":"Pourcel","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Dentovskaya","given":"Svetlana V."},{"family":"Anisimov","given":"Andrey P."},{"family":"Yang","given":"Ruifu"},{"family":"Vergnaud","given":"Gilles"}],"citation-key":"li2009GenotypingPhylogeneticAnalysis","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0006000","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,6,22]]},"language":"en","page":"e6000","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Genotyping and phylogenetic analysis of <i>Yersinia pestis</i> by MLVA: insights into the worldwide expansion of Central Asia plague foci","title-short":"Genotyping and Phylogenetic Analysis of Yersinia pestis by MLVA","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0006000","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"little2007PlagueEndAntiquity","abstract":"Plague was a key factor in the waning of Antiquity and the beginning of the Middle Ages. Eight centuries before the Black Death, a pandemic of plague engulfed the lands surrounding the Mediterranean Sea and eventually extended as far east as Persia and as far north as the British Isles. Its persisted sporadically from 541 to 750, the same period that witnessed the distinctive shaping of the Byzantine Empire, a new prominence of the Roman papacy and of monasticism, the beginnings of Islam and the meteoric expansion of the Arabic Empire, the ascent of the Carolingian dynasty in Frankish Gaul and, not coincidentally, the beginnings of a positive work ethic in the Latin West. In this volume, the first on the subject, twelve scholars from a variety of disciplines-history, archaeology, epidemiology, and molecular biology- have produced a comprehensive account of the pandemic's origins, spread, and mortality, as well as its economic, social, political, and religious effects. The historians examine written sources in a range of languages, including Arabic, Syriac, Greek, Latin, and Old Irish. Archaeologists analyze burial pits, abandoned villages, and aborted building projects. The epidemiologists use the written sources to track the disease's means and speed of transmission, the mix of vulnerability and resistance it encountered, and the patterns of reappearence over time. Finally, molecular biologists, newcomers to this kind of investigation, have become pioneers of paleopathology, seeking ways to identity pathogens in human remains from the remote past.","author":[{"family":"Little","given":"Lester K."}],"citation-key":"little2007PlagueEndAntiquity","ISBN":"978-0-521-84639-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"313","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Plague and the End of Antiquity: The Pandemic of 541-750","title-short":"Plague and the End of Antiquity","type":"book","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511812934"},

  {"id":"losch2019UncoveringGenomicHistory","abstract":"Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, has affected humans in Eurasia since 5,000 years ago and was the main culprit of two historically recorded pandemics that caused immense populating declines between the 6th century AD and the Early Modern Era. The present study focuses on the second plague pandemic, which began with the Black Death (1346-1353 AD) and persisted with repeated epidemics in Europe until the 18th century AD. Here, we report over 30 ancient Y. pestis genomes spanning the 14th to 17th century AD through the analysis of human remains from epidemics cemeteries across the continent. Our data support historical sources suggesting an initial entry of the bacterium from Eastern Europe. In addition, we show an absence of genetic diversity in the bacterium during the Black Death as well as low diversity during local outbreaks thereafter. Analysis of post-Black Death genomes shows the diversification of a Y. pestis lineage into multiple genetically distinct clades that may have given rise to more than one disease reservoir in, or close to, Europe. Finally, through integration of the newly generated genomes with available modern and ancient Y. pestis datasets, we show the loss of a genomic region that includes virulence-associated genes in strains associated with late stages of the second plague pandemic (17th - 18th century AD). This deletion could not be detected in extant strains within our modern dataset, though it was identified among the most derived isolates of a today-extinct lineage associated with the first plague pandemic (6th - 8th century AD), potentiating a case of convergent evolution between both pandemic events within Europe.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Lösch","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Alterauge","given":"Amelie Sophie"}],"citation-key":"losch2019UncoveringGenomicHistory","event":"Reconstructing the Human Past - Using Ancient and Modern Genomics","event-place":"Heidelberg","genre":"info:eu-repo/semantics/conferenceObject","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,3]]},"language":"eng","publisher-place":"Heidelberg","title":"Uncovering the genomic history of the second plague pandemic through analysis of historical Yersinia pestis genomes","type":"speech","URL":"https://www.embo-embl-symposia.org/symposia/2019/EES19-02/programme/index.html"},
  {"id":"mackenzie2016PostarchivalGenomicsBulk","abstract":"DNA sequence data are currently viewed as a ‘bedrock’ or ‘backbone’ of modern biological science. This article traces DNA sequence data produced by so-called ‘next generation sequencing’ (NGS) platforms as it moves into a biological data infrastructure called the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). Since 2007, the SRA has been the leading repository for NGS-produced nucleotide (DNA and RNA) sequences. The way sequence data move into the SRA, we suggest, is symptomatic of a decisive shift towards post-archival genomics. This term refers to the increasing importance of the logistics rather than the biology of sequence data. In the SRA, logistical concerns with the bulk movements of sequence data somewhat supplant the emphasis in previous genomic and biological databases on contextualising particular sequences and cross-linking between different forms of biological data. At the same time, post-archival logistics do not necessarily flatten genomic research into global genomic homogeneity. Rather, the SRA provides evidence of an increasingly polymorphous flow of sequence data deriving from an expansion and diversification of sequencing techniques and instruments. The patterns of movement of data in and around the SRA suggest that sequence data are proliferating in various overlapping and sometimes disparate forms. By mapping differences in content across the SRA, by tracking patterns of absence or ‘missingness’ in metadata, and by following how changes in file formats highlight uncertainties in the definitions of seemingly obvious DNA-related artefacts such as a sequencer ‘run’, we highlight the growing lability of nucleotide sequence data. The movements of data in the SRA attest to a decisive mutation in sequences from biological bedrock to an increasingly expandable material whose epistemic and technological value remains open to reinvention.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Mackenzie","given":"Adrian"},{"family":"McNally","given":"Ruth"},{"family":"Mills","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Sharples","given":"Stuart"}],"citation-key":"mackenzie2016PostarchivalGenomicsBulk","container-title":"BioSocieties","DOI":"10.1057/biosoc.2015.22","ISSN":"1745-8552, 1745-8560","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,3]]},"language":"en","page":"82-105","source":"Crossref","title":"Post-archival genomics and the bulk logistics of DNA sequences","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1057/biosoc.2015.22","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"mcbroome2022IdentifyingSARSCoV2Regional","abstract":"The unprecedented SARS-CoV-2 global sequencing effort has suffered from an analytical bottleneck. Many existing methods for phylogenetic analysis are designed for sparse, static datasets and are too computationally expensive to apply to densely sampled, rapidly expanding datasets when results are needed immediately to inform public health action. For example, public health is often concerned with identifying clusters of closely related samples, but the sheer scale of the data prevents manual inspection and the current computational models are often too expensive in time and resources. Even when results are available, intuitive data exploration tools are of critical importance to effective public health interpretation and action. To help address this need, we present a phylogenetic summary statistic which quickly and efficiently identifies newly introduced strains in a region, resulting clusters of infected individuals, and their putative geographic origins. We show that this approach performs well on simulated data and is congruent with a more sophisticated analysis performed during the pandemic. We also introduce Cluster Tracker (https://clustertracker.gi.ucsc.edu/), a novel interactive web-based tool to facilitate effective and intuitive SARS-CoV-2 geographic data exploration and visualization. Cluster-Tracker is updated daily and automatically identifies and highlights groups of closely related SARS-CoV-2 infections resulting from inter-regional transmission across the United States, streamlining public health tracking of local viral diversity and emerging infection clusters. The combination of these open-source tools will empower detailed investigations of the geographic origins and spread of SARS-CoV-2 and other densely-sampled pathogens.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,1]]},"author":[{"family":"McBroome","given":"Jakob"},{"family":"Martin","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Schneider","given":"Adriano de Bernardi"},{"family":"Turakhia","given":"Yatish"},{"family":"Corbett-Detig","given":"Russell"}],"citation-key":"mcbroome2022IdentifyingSARSCoV2Regional","DOI":"10.1101/2022.01.07.22268918","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,10]]},"language":"en","page":"2022.01.07.22268918","publisher":"medRxiv","source":"medRxiv","title":"Identifying SARS-CoV-2 regional introductions and transmission clusters in real time","type":"article","URL":"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.07.22268918v1"},

Although it is known that the degree of sequence divergence significantly affects the calculation of evolutionary metrics in viral outbreaks, the extent and duration of this effect during an actual outbreak remains unclear. We have analyzed how limited divergence time during an early viral outbreak affects the accuracy of molecular evolutionary metrics. Using sequence data from the first 25 months of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) outbreak, we calculated each of three different standard evolutionary metrics—molecular clock rate (i.e., evolutionary rate), whole-gene dN/dS, and site-wise dN/dS—for hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, using increasingly longer time windows, from 1 month to 25 months. For the molecular clock rate, we found that at least 3–4 months of temporal divergence from the start of sampling was required to make precise estimates that also agreed with long-term values. For whole-gene dN/dS, we found that at least 2 months of data were required to generate precise estimates, but 6–9 months were required for estimates to approach their long term values. For site-wise dN/dS estimates, we found that at least 6 months of sampling divergence was required before the majority of sites had at least one mutation and were thus evolutionarily informative. Furthermore, 8 months of sampling divergence was required before the site-wise estimates appropriately reflected the distribution of values expected from known protein-structure-based evolutionary pressure in influenza. In summary, we found that evolutionary metrics calculated from gene sequence data in early outbreaks should be expected to deviate from their long-term estimates for at least several months after the initial emergence and sequencing of the virus.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Meyer","given":"Austin G."},{"family":"Spielman","given":"Stephanie J."},{"family":"Bedford","given":"Trevor"},{"family":"Wilke","given":"Claus O."}],"citation-key":"meyer2015TimeDependenceEvolutionary","container-title":"Virus Evolution","container-title-short":"Virus Evol","DOI":"10.1093/ve/vev006","ISSN":"2057-1577","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,8,24]]},"page":"vev006","PMCID":"PMC4710376","PMID":"26770819","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Time dependence of evolutionary metrics during the 2009 pandemic influenza virus outbreak","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4710376/","volume":"1"},

There was not a man who escaped the instantaneous death after being infected with the miasma. Tau-Nan composed thereon a poem, entitled “Death of Rats,” the masterpiece of his; and a few days after, he himself died from this queer rat epidemic.”","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Minakata","given":"Kumagusu"}],"citation-key":"minakata1899PlagueChina","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/059370b0","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"1529","issued":{"date-parts":[[1899,2]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research","number":"1529","page":"370-370","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Plague in China","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/059370b0","volume":"59"},

  {"id":"miura2020NewMethodInferring","abstract":"Pathogen timetrees are phylogenies scaled to time. They reveal the temporal history of a pathogen spread through the populations as captured in the evolutionary history of strains. These timetrees are inferred by using molecular sequences of pathogenic strains sampled at different times. That is, temporally sampled sequences enable the inference of sequence divergence times. Here, we present a new approach (RelTime with Dated Tips [RTDT]) to estimating pathogen timetrees based on a relative rate framework underlying the RelTime approach that is algebraic in nature and distinct from all other current methods. RTDT does not require many of the priors demanded by Bayesian approaches, and it has light computing requirements. In analyses of an extensive collection of computer-simulated datasets, we found the accuracy of RTDT time estimates and the coverage probabilities of their confidence intervals (CIs) to be excellent. In analyses of empirical datasets, RTDT produced dates that were similar to those reported in the literature. In comparative benchmarking with Bayesian and non-Bayesian methods (LSD, TreeTime, and treedater), we found that no method performed the best in every scenario. So, we provide a brief guideline for users to select the most appropriate method in empirical data analysis.

While the evolutionary histories of many of the biovars and strains of pathogenic Yersinia species are well documented, the origins of many of the individual virulence factors have not been comprehensively examined. Here, the evolutionary origins of the genes coding for a set of Yersinia outer protein (Yop) virulence factors were investigated through phylogenetic reconstruction and subsequence analysis. It was found that many of these genes had only a few sequenced homologs and none of the resolved phylogenies recovered the same relationships as was resolved from chromosomal analyses. Many of the evolutionary relationships differ greatly among genes on the plasmid, and variation is also found across different domains of the same gene, which provides evidence of the mosaic nature of the plasmid as well as multiple genes on the plasmid. This mosaic aspect also relates to patterns of selection, which vary among the studied domains.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Moorman","given":"Veronica R."},{"family":"Cohen","given":"James I."}],"citation-key":"moorman2021InsightsIndividualEvolutionary","container-title":"Plasmid","container-title-short":"Plasmid","DOI":"10.1016/j.plasmid.2021.102562","ISSN":"0147-619X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,23]]},"language":"en","page":"102562","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Insights into the individual evolutionary origins of Yersinia virulence factor effector proteins","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147619X21000093"},

In this article, we argue that this paradigm does not fit the evidence. We examine a series of independent quantitative and qualitative datasets that are directly or indirectly linked to demographic and economic trends during this two-century period: Written sources, legislation, coinage, papyri, inscriptions, pollen, ancient DNA, and mortuary archaeology. Individually or together, they fail to support the maximalist paradigm: None has a clear independent link to plague outbreaks and none supports maximalist reconstructions of late antique plague. Instead of large-scale, disruptive mortality, when contextualized and examined together, the datasets suggest continuity across the plague period. Although demographic, economic, and political changes continued between the 6th and 8th centuries, the evidence does not support the now commonplace claim that the Justinianic Plague was a primary causal factor of them.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Mordechai","given":"Lee"},{"family":"Eisenberg","given":"Merle"},{"family":"Newfield","given":"Timothy P."},{"family":"Izdebski","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Kay","given":"Janet E."},{"family":"Poinar","given":"Hendrik"}],"citation-key":"mordechai2019JustinianicPlagueInconsequential","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1903797116","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"51","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,17]]},"language":"en","page":"25546-25554","PMID":"31792176","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"PNAS Plus","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"The Justinianic Plague: an inconsequential pandemic?","title-short":"The Justinianic Plague","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/116/51/25546","volume":"116"},

Here, we review the difficulties of inferring reliable phylogenies by example of a data snapshot comprising a quality-filtered subset of 8,736 out of all 16,453 virus sequences available on May 5, 2020 from gisaid.org. We find that it is difficult to infer a reliable phylogeny on these data due to the large number of sequences in conjunction with the low number of mutations. We further find that rooting the inferred phylogeny with some degree of confidence either via the bat and pangolin outgroups or by applying novel computational methods on the ingroup phylogeny does not appear to be credible. Finally, an automatic classification of the current sequences into subclasses using the mPTP tool for molecular species delimitation is also, as might be expected, not possible, as the sequences are too closely related. We conclude that, although the application of phylogenetic methods to disentangle the evolution and spread of COVID-19 provides some insight, results of phylogenetic analyses, in particular those conducted under the default settings of current phylogenetic inference tools, as well as downstream analyses on the inferred phylogenies, should be considered and interpreted with extreme caution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Morel","given":"Benoit"},{"family":"Barbera","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Czech","given":"Lucas"},{"family":"Bettisworth","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Hübner","given":"Lukas"},{"family":"Lutteropp","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Serdari","given":"Dora"},{"family":"Kostaki","given":"Evangelia-Georgia"},{"family":"Mamais","given":"Ioannis"},{"family":"Kozlov","given":"Alexey M"},{"family":"Pavlidis","given":"Pavlos"},{"family":"Paraskevis","given":"Dimitrios"},{"family":"Stamatakis","given":"Alexandros"}],"citation-key":"morel2021PhylogeneticAnalysisSARSCoV2","container-title":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1093/molbev/msaa314","ISSN":"1537-1719","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,1]]},"page":"1777-1791","source":"Silverchair","title":"Phylogenetic Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Data Is Difficult","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaa314","volume":"38"},

We conducted phylogenetic analyses on this sequence variation dataset, assigned isolates to populations based on maximum parsimony and, from these results, made inferences regarding historical transmission routes. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that Y. pestis evolved in or near China and spread through multiple radiations to Europe, South America, Africa and Southeast Asia, leading to country-specific lineages that can be traced by lineage-specific SNPs. All 626 current isolates from the United States reflect one radiation, and 82 isolates from Madagascar represent a second radiation.

Analyses of the genetic diversity of ancient strains of Y. pestis have shed light on the mechanisms of evolution and the spread of plague in Europe. However, many questions regarding the origins of the pathogen and its long persistence in Europe are still unresolved, especially during the late medieval time period. To address this, we present four newly assembled Y. pestis genomes from Eastern Europe (Poland and Southern Russia), dating from the fifteenth to eighteenth century AD. The analysis of polymorphisms in these genomes and their phylogenetic relationships with other ancient and modern Y. pestis strains may suggest several independent introductions of plague into Eastern Europe or its persistence in different reservoirs. Furthermore, with the reconstruction of a partial Y. pestis genome from rat skeletal remains found in a Polish ossuary, we were able to identify a potential animal reservoir in late medieval Europe.

Polymorphisms in the main open reading frames were identified and compared to those in the main lineages of epidemiological concern: B.1.1.7 (UK) and B.1.351 (South Africa).\nResults\nAcross 16 South American countries, 169 lineages were identified; major lineage B had the greatest diversity and broadest geographic distribution. Seventeen predominant lineages were analyzed revealing 2 dominant lineages of concern: P.1 (Brazilian variant) and B.1.1.7 with 94 and 28 genomes, respectively, both with 33 polymorphisms (other lineages displayed ≤24 polymorphisms). A high number of polymorphisms were detected with a limited number of common variable positions, in common with the profile of the main lineages of epidemiological concern.\nConclusions\nThe ever-increasing genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 continues to lead to novel lineage emergence.

Sequencing data is captured in a public primary data archive, the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). As of January 2013, data from more than 14,000 projects have been submitted to SRA, which is double that of the previous year. Researchers can download raw sequence data from SRA website to perform further analyses and to compare with their own data. However, it is extremely difficult to search entries and download raw sequences of interests with SRA because the data structure is complicated, and experimental conditions along with raw sequences are partly described in natural language. Additionally, some sequences are of inconsistent quality because anyone can submit sequencing data to SRA with no quality check. Therefore, as a criterion of data quality, we focused on SRA entries that were cited in journal articles. We extracted SRA IDs and PubMed IDs (PMIDs) from SRA and fulltext versions of journal articles and retrieved 2748 SRA ID-PMID pairs. We constructed a publication list referring to SRA entries. Since, one of the main themes of -omics analyses is clarification of disease mechanisms, we also characterized SRA entries by disease keywords, according to the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) extracted from articles assigned to each SRA entry. We obtained 989 SRA ID-MeSH disease term pairs, and constructed a disease list referring to SRA data. We previously developed feature profiles of diseases in a system called ‘‘Gendoo’’. We generated hyperlinks between diseases extracted from SRA and the feature profiles of it.

  {"id":"newsom2006PioneersInfectionControl","abstract":"John Snow was one of the founders of epidemiology. Already convinced of the value of pure water, he analysed the distribution of cholera cases in the 1848 epidemic in relation to the purity of the water supply in London. His hypothesis that cholera was spread by contaminated water was tested by the ‘Broad Street’ epidemic of 1854. Snow quickly traced the water used in the houses affected by cholera to the pump in Broad Street, and persuaded the parish council to remove the handle. The epidemic subsided. The council did not really believe Snow, so the curate, Henry Whitehead, set out to repeat Snow's work, albeit at a more leisurely pace as the epidemic had subsided. He located 700 deaths within a 250-yard radius and showed that use of water from the Broad Street pump was strongly correlated with death from cholera. This surprised him as he had drunk water from the pump himself during the outbreak. Thus ‘geographical epidemiology’ began, although it was some years before Snow's observations were generally accepted.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Newsom","given":"S.

  {"id":"nguyen20182017PlagueOutbreak","abstract":"From August to November 2017, Madagascar endured an outbreak of plague. A total of 2417 cases of plague were confirmed, causing a death toll of 209. Public health intervention efforts were introduced and successfully stopped the epidemic at the end of November. The plague, however, is endemic in the region and occurs annually, posing the risk of future outbreaks. To understand the plague transmission, we collected real-time data from official reports, described the outbreak's characteristics, and estimated transmission parameters using statistical and mathematical models. The pneumonic plague epidemic curve exhibited multiple peaks, coinciding with sporadic introductions of new bubonic cases. Optimal climate conditions for rat flea to flourish were observed during the epidemic. Estimate of the plague basic reproduction number during the large wave of the epidemic was high, ranging from 5 to 7 depending on model assumptions. The incubation and infection periods for bubonic and pneumonic plague were 4.3 and 3.4 days and 3.8 and 2.9 days, respectively. Parameter estimation suggested that even with a small fraction of the population exposed to infected rat fleas (1/10,000) and a small probability of transition from a bubonic case to a secondary pneumonic case (3%), the high human-to-human transmission rate can still generate a large outbreak. Controlling rodent and fleas can prevent new index cases, but managing human-to-human transmission is key to prevent large-scale outbreaks.","author":[{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Van Kinh"},{"family":"Parra-Rojas","given":"César"},{"family":"Hernandez-Vargas","given":"Esteban A."}],"citation-key":"nguyen20182017PlagueOutbreak","container-title":"Epidemics","container-title-short":"Epidemics","DOI":"10.1016/j.epidem.2018.05.001","ISSN":"1878-0067","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,12]]},"language":"eng","page":"20-25","PMID":"29866421","source":"PubMed","title":"The 2017 plague outbreak in Madagascar: Data descriptions and epidemic modelling","title-short":"The 2017 plague outbreak in Madagascar","type":"article-journal","volume":"25"},

The genomes of strains of two other clusters also differ in a large number of individual SNPs, 32 and 36, respectively. One of them includes strains from the Pre-Sevan mountain, Zangezur-Karabakh mountain, and Pre-Araks low-mountain foci with the grouping within the cluster of three separate subclusters: Pre-Sevan (IIa), Zangezur-Karabakh (IIb), and Zangezur-Karabakh-Pre-Araks (IIc).

  {"id":"oconnor1992PetsPestsRoman","abstract":"Humans and other vertebrates interact in a variety of relationships which are inadequately described by a simple division of these other animals into wild, feral, tame, and domestic taxa. Discussion of the process and semantic meaning of domestication has largely taken place in the context of the adoption of settled agriculture, but is equally relevant to complex urban societies. Certain species adopted a synanthropic relationship in the first ‘villages’of the early Holocene, and co-existence with pets has a similar antiquity. The nature of the relationship between people and their pets is complex, and scarcely amenable to archaeological investigation, as part of the mutual benefit has an emotional basis, or centres on the symbolic role of certain species within different societies. The status of Cats in medieval towns in Britain and Ireland is a case in point, with opinions varying from the exploitation of Cats for skins, through neglected feral living, to a pet status much as today. The truth probably subsumes all three interpretations. Rats seem to have adapted to commensalism in northern Europe more slowly than Mice, and there may be evidence that Rats were more vulnerable to changes in habitat. Archaeology can usefully examine the community ecology of Roman and medieval towns, but any such research must move away from simple concepts of wild or domestic status.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,1]]},"author":[{"family":"O'Connor","given":"T.

  {"id":"ondov2011InteractiveMetagenomicVisualization","abstract":"Background: A critical output of metagenomic studies is the estimation of abundances of taxonomical or functional groups. The inherent uncertainty in assignments to these groups makes it important to consider both their hierarchical contexts and their prediction confidence. The current tools for visualizing metagenomic data, however, omit or distort quantitative hierarchical relationships and lack the facility for displaying secondary variables.\nResults: Here we present Krona, a new visualization tool that allows intuitive exploration of relative abundances and confidences within the complex hierarchies of metagenomic classifications. Krona combines a variant of radial, space-filling displays with parametric coloring and interactive polar-coordinate zooming. The HTML5 and JavaScript implementation enables fully interactive charts that can be explored with any modern Web browser, without the need for installed software or plug-ins. This Web-based architecture also allows each chart to be an independent document, making them easy to share via e-mail or post to a standard Web server. To illustrate Krona’s utility, we describe its application to various metagenomic data sets and its compatibility with popular metagenomic analysis tools.\nConclusions: Krona is both a powerful metagenomic visualization tool and a demonstration of the potential of HTML5 for highly accessible bioinformatic visualizations. Its rich and interactive displays facilitate more informed interpretations of metagenomic analyses, while its implementation as a browser-based application makes it extremely portable and easily adopted into existing analysis packages.

  {"id":"ortner2007DifferentialDiagnosisSkeletal","abstract":"Without doubt infectious pathogens have been an important challenge for hominines throughout the evolutionary process. With the advent of major changes in the relationship between Homo sapiens and the environment that occurred in the Holocene, it is highly likely that the effect of pathogens became more serious. This is both because of an increased number of organisms pathogenic to humans and because of the increased exposure to infectious pathogens that inevitably came with animal domestication and greater population density associated with agriculture, sedentary human societies and urbanism. Exploring the significance of infection in past human societies is a challenging exercise in which multiple lines of evidence must be exploited. One of these is the evidence of infectious disease that is present in archaeological human skeletal populations. One of the limitations of this evidence is that most of the infectious diseases that cause severe morbidity and mortality are acute diseases and rarely affect the skeleton. Some of the more chronic infectious diseases can affect the skeleton, but most individuals with these diseases will not have skeletal involvement. Nevertheless, the presence of these diseases in archaeological human skeletal samples provides at least some evidence regarding the health of past populations. The quality of these data depends on the accuracy with which observations about the prevalence of infectious disease in skeletal samples are made. The objective of this chapter is to provide the reader with a brief summary of the most typical skeletal manifestations of the infectious pathogens that most often cause disease in human groups and which also can be identified in at least some cases in human skeletal remains.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Ortner","given":"Donald J."}],"citation-key":"ortner2007DifferentialDiagnosisSkeletal","container-title":"Advances in Human Palaeopathology","DOI":"10.1002/9780470724187.ch10","ISBN":"978-0-470-72418-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9780470724187.ch10","page":"189-214","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","section":"10","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Differential Diagnosis of Skeletal Lesions in Infectious Disease","type":"chapter","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9780470724187.ch10"},

Significant differences in the rate of evolution were found between subtypes, with subtypes C and A1 and CRF01_AE displaying the highest rates. On the other hand, CRF02_AG and subtype D were the slowest evolving types. Using a different molecular clock model for each genomic partition led to more precise tMRCA estimates than when linking the same clock along the HIV genome. Overall, the earliest tMRCA corresponded to subtype A1 (median = 1941, 95% HPD = 1943–55), whereas the most recent tMRCA corresponded to subtype G and CRF01_AE subset 3 (median = 1971, 95% HPD = 1967–75 and median = 1972, 95% HPD = 1970–75, respectively). These results suggest that both biological and epidemiological differences among HIV-1M subtypes are reflected in their evolutionary dynamics. The estimates obtained for tMRCAs and substitution rates provide information that can be used as prior distributions in future Bayesian coalescent analyses of specific HIV-1 subtypes/CRFs and genes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Patiño-Galindo","given":"Juan Ángel"},{"family":"González-Candelas","given":"Fernando"}],"citation-key":"patino-galindo2017SubstitutionRateHIV1","container-title":"Virus Evolution","container-title-short":"Virus Evol","DOI":"10.1093/ve/vex029","ISSN":"2057-1577","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,20]]},"page":"vex029","PMCID":"PMC6007745","PMID":"29942652","source":"PubMed Central","title":"The substitution rate of HIV-1 subtypes: a genomic approach","title-short":"The substitution rate of HIV-1 subtypes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6007745/","volume":"3"},
  {"id":"pearson2009PhylogeneticUnderstandingClonal","abstract":"Phylogenetic hypotheses using whole genome sequences have the potential for unprecedented accuracy, yet a failure to understand issues associated with discovery bias, character sampling, and strain sampling can lead to highly erroneous conclusions. For microbial pathogens, phylogenies derived from whole genome sequences are becoming more common, as large numbers of characters distributed across entire genomes can yield extremely accurate phylogenies, particularly for strictly clonal populations. The availability of whole genomes is increasing as new sequencing technologies reduce the cost and time required for genome sequencing. Until entire sample collections can be fully sequenced, harnessing the phylogenetic power from whole genome sequences in more than a small subset of fully sequenced strains requires the integration of whole genome and partial genome genotyping data. Such integration involves discovering evolutionarily stable polymorphic characters by whole genome comparisons, then determining allelic states across a wide panel of isolates using high-throughput genotyping technologies. Here, we demonstrate how such an approach using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) yields highly accurate, but biased phylogenetic reconstructions and how the accuracy of the resulting tree is compromised by incomplete taxon and character sampling. Despite recent phylogenetic work detailing the strengths and biases of integrating whole genome and partial genome genotype data, these issues are relatively new and remain poorly understood by many researchers. Here, we revisit these biases and provide strategies for maximizing phylogenetic accuracy. Although we write this review with bacterial pathogens in mind, these concepts apply to any clonally reproducing population or indeed to any evolutionarily stable marker that is inherited in a strictly clonal manner. Understanding the ways in which current and emerging technologies can be used to maximize phylogenetic knowledge is advantageous only with a complete understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of these methods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Pearson","given":"Talima"},{"family":"Okinaka","given":"Richard T."},{"family":"Foster","given":"Jeffrey T."},{"family":"Keim","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"pearson2009PhylogeneticUnderstandingClonal","container-title":"Infection, Genetics and Evolution","container-title-short":"Infection, Genetics and Evolution","DOI":"10.1016/j.meegid.2009.05.014","ISSN":"1567-1348","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1010-1019","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Phylogenetic understanding of clonal populations in an era of whole genome sequencing","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134809001294","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"pham2009CorrelatesEnvironmentalFactors","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Human plague caused by Yersinia pestis remains a public health threat in endemic countries, because the disease is associated with increased risk of mortality and severe economic and social consequences. During the past 10 years, outbreaks of plague have occasionally occurred in Vietnam's Central Highlands region. The present study sought to describe and analyse the occurrence of plague and its association with ecological factors.\nMETHODS: The study included all 510 communes of the Central Highlands region (with a total population of approximately 4 million) where 95% of incidence of plague cases in Vietnam had been reported from 1997 through 2002. Plague was clinically ascertained by using a standard protocol by WHO. Data on domestic fleas and rodents were obtained by using traps and periodic surveillance in accordance with the WHO guidelines. Temperature, duration of sunshine, rainfall and humidity were recorded as monthly averages by local meteorological stations. The association between these ecological factors and plague was assessed by using the Poisson regression model.\nRESULTS: From 1997 through 2002, 472 cases of plague were reported, of whom 24 (5.1%) died. The incidence of plague peaked during the dry season, with approximately 63% of cases occurring from February through April. The risk of plague occurrence was associated with an increased monthly flea index (RR and 95% CI: 1.93; 1.61-2.33 for months with the flea index >1) and increased rodent density (RR 1.23; 1.15-1.32 per each 3% increase in density). Moreover, the risk of plague increased during the dry season (RR 2.07; 1.64-2.62), when rainfall fell <10 mm (RR 1.44; 1.17-1.77).\nCONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the flea index, rodent density and rainfall could be used as ecological indicators of plague risk in Vietnam. The data also suggest that the occurrence of plague in Vietnam's Central Highlands is likely resulted from multiple causes that remain to be delineated.","author":[{"family":"Pham","given":"Hau V."},{"family":"Dang","given":"Dat T."},{"family":"Tran Minh","given":"Nguyen N."},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Nguyen D."},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Tuan V."}],"citation-key":"pham2009CorrelatesEnvironmentalFactors","container-title":"International Journal of Epidemiology","container-title-short":"Int J Epidemiol","DOI":"10.1093/ije/dyp244","ISSN":"1464-3685","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,12]]},"language":"eng","page":"1634-1641","PMCID":"PMC2800783","PMID":"19584125","source":"PubMed","title":"Correlates of environmental factors and human plague: an ecological study in Vietnam","title-short":"Correlates of environmental factors and human plague","type":"article-journal","volume":"38"},

The world is now facing the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Many infectious diseases leading to pandemics are caused by zoonotic pathogens that were transmitted to humans due to increased contacts with animals through breeding, hunting and global trade activities. The understanding of the mechanisms of transmission of pathogens to humans allowed the establishment of methods to prevent and control infections. During centuries, implementation of public health measures such as isolation, quarantine and border control helped to contain the spread of infectious diseases and maintain the structure of the society. In the absence of pharmaceutical interventions, these containment methods have still been used nowadays to control COVID-19 pandemic. Global surveillance programs of water-borne pathogens, vector-borne diseases and zoonotic spillovers at the animal-human interface are of prime importance to rapidly detect the emergence of infectious threats.

There are 13 natural plague foci in the Caucasus, located on the territory of the Russian Federation, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia. We performed whole-genome sequencing of Y. pestis strains, isolated in the natural foci of the Caucasus and Transcaucasia. Using the data of whole-genome SNP analysis and Bayesian phylogeny methods, we carried out an evolutionary-phylogeographic analysis of modern population of the plague pathogen in order to determine the phylogenetic relationships of Y. pestis strains from the Caucasus with the strains from other countries.\nResults\nWe used 345 Y. pestis genomes to construct a global evolutionary phylogenetic reconstruction of species based on whole-genome SNP analysis. The genomes of 16 isolates were sequenced in this study, the remaining 329 genomes were obtained from the GenBank database. Analysis of the core genome revealed 3315 SNPs that allow differentiation of strains. The evolutionary phylogeographic analysis showed that the studied Y. pestis strains belong to the genetic lineages 0.PE2, 2.MED0, and 2.MED1. It was shown that the Y. pestis strains isolated on the territory of the East Caucasian high-mountain, the Transcaucasian high-mountain and the Priaraksinsky low-mountain plague foci belong to the most ancient of all existing genetic lineages - 0.PE2.\nConclusions\nOn the basis of the whole-genome SNP analysis of 345 Y. pestis strains, we describe the modern population structure of the plague pathogen and specify the place of the strains isolated in the natural foci of the Caucasus and Transcaucasia in the structure of the global population of Y. pestis.

  {"id":"qi2016TaxonomyYersiniaPestis","abstract":"This chapter summarized the taxonomy and typing works of Yersinia pestis since it’s firstly identified in Hong Kong in 1894. Phenotyping methods that based on phenotypic characteristics, including biotyping, serotyping, antibiogram analysis, bacteriocin typing, phage typing, and plasmid typing, were firstly applied in classification of Y. pestis in subspecies level. And then, with the advancement of molecular biological technology, the methods based on outer membrane protein profiles, fatty acid composition, and bacterial mass fingerprinting were also used to identify the populations within Y. pestis. However, Y. pestis is a highly homogenous species; therefore, the above typing methods could only provide low resolution, e.g., only one serotype and one phage type were observed for the whole species. Since the 1990s, molecular typing based on DNA variations, including single-nucleotide polymorphism, gene gain/loss, variable-number tandem repeats, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat, etc., was introduced and improved the resolution and robust of typing result. Especially in recent years, genotyping-based whole-genome-wide variations were successfully employed in Y. pestis, which built the “gold standard” of typing scheme of the species and could distinguish the samples under the strain level. The taxonomy and typing works leaved us enormous polymorphism data; therefore, a comprehensive fingerprint database of Y. pestis was needed to collect and standardize these data, for facilitating future works on evolution, plague surveillance and control, anti-bioterrorism, and microbial forensic researches.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Qi","given":"Zhizhen"},{"family":"Cui","given":"Yujun"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Qingwen"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Ruifu"}],"citation-key":"qi2016TaxonomyYersiniaPestis","collection-title":"Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology","container-title":"Yersinia pestis: Retrospective and Perspective","DOI":"10.1007/978-94-024-0890-4_3","editor":[{"family":"Yang","given":"Ruifu"},{"family":"Anisimov","given":"Andrey"}],"event-place":"Dordrecht","ISBN":"978-94-024-0890-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","page":"35-78","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher-place":"Dordrecht","source":"Springer Link","title":"Taxonomy of Yersinia pestis","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-024-0890-4_3"},
  {"id":"querejeta2016GenomicDiversityGeographical","abstract":"The Pyrenean desman (Galemys pyrenaicus) is a small semi-aquatic mammal endemic to the Iberian Peninsula. The species has recently experienced a strong decline and some of its populations are severely threatened with extinction. To help in the preservation of this species, it is critical to understand its genetic structure and main evolutionary units, as these may have specific local adaptations and could be of great conservation value. Sequencing reduced representation libraries (ddRAD) from 26 specimens selected from across its entire range, we obtained around 45,000 loci per specimen and 1185 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Heterozygosity varied substantially among individuals from different areas. Interestingly, specimens from the southeastern Pyrenees had some of the lowest proportions of heterozygous positions inferred from genome-wide data in mammals so far. In addition, we estimated a tree reflecting genomic divergence, performed a principal component analysis, and carried out a Bayesian analysis of the population structure. Combined evidence supported the existence of five distinct genomic clusters largely coincident with the main mountain ranges where the species occurs, with few specimens presenting relevant admixture levels. There was good correspondence between these populations and the mitochondrial lineages detected in a previous study, yet substantial differences in some areas demonstrate the importance of performing genomic analysis to reveal the whole population history. Although the analysis of further specimens is necessary to better characterize the distribution of the different evolutionary units, the distinctive geographical structure of this species revealed by the genomic data should be considered in future conservation plans.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Querejeta","given":"Marina"},{"family":"González-Esteban","given":"Jorge"},{"family":"Gómez","given":"Asunción"},{"family":"Fernández-González","given":"Angel"},{"family":"Aymerich","given":"Pere"},{"family":"Gosálbez","given":"Joaquim"},{"family":"Escoda","given":"Lídia"},{"family":"Igea","given":"Javier"},{"family":"Castresana","given":"Jose"}],"citation-key":"querejeta2016GenomicDiversityGeographical","container-title":"Conservation Genetics","container-title-short":"Conserv Genet","DOI":"10.1007/s10592-016-0865-y","ISSN":"1572-9737","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1333-1344","source":"Springer Link","title":"Genomic diversity and geographical structure of the Pyrenean desman","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10592-016-0865-y","volume":"17"},

Multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) allowed the isolates to be divided into three clusters based on the relatedness of their MLVA proﬁles. The two monkey isolates shared the same MLVA pattern with 15 of the cattle isolates, whereas the remaining three cattle isolates had different patterns, even though the latter animals had been kept in the same dairy farm.

Here, we present a rational and dynamic virus nomenclature that uses a phylogenetic framework to identify those lineages that contribute most to active spread. Our system is made tractable by constraining the number and depth of hierarchical lineage labels and by flagging and delabelling virus lineages that become unobserved and hence are probably inactive.

Since the 1990s, Africa has accounted for the majority of reported human cases. In Uganda, plague cases occur in the West Nile region, near the border with Democratic Republic of Congo. Despite the ongoing risk of contracting plague in this region, little is known about Y. pestis genotypes causing human disease.\nMethodology/Principal Findings During January 2004–December 2012, 1,092 suspect human plague cases were recorded in the West Nile region of Uganda. Sixty-one cases were culture-confirmed. Recovered Y. pestis isolates were analyzed using three typing methods, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and multiple variable number of tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) and subpopulations analyzed in the context of associated geographic, temporal, and clinical data for source patients. All three methods separated the 61 isolates into two distinct 1.ANT lineages, which persisted throughout the 9 year period and were associated with differences in elevation and geographic distribution.\nConclusions/Significance We demonstrate that human cases of plague in the West Nile region of Uganda are caused by two distinct 1.ANT genetic subpopulations. Notably, all three typing methods used, SNPs, PFGE, and MLVA, identified the two genetic subpopulations, despite recognizing different mutation types in the Y. pestis genome.

  {"id":"roberts2019MediterraneanLandscapeChange","abstract":"This synthesis paper offers a comparative perspective on how seven different Mediterranean regions, from Iberia and Morocco to the Levant, have been transformed by human and natural agencies during the past 10 millennia. It draws on a range of data sources: notably (1) archaeological site surveys (n = 32,000) and 14C dates (n = 12,000) as proxies for long-term population change, (2) pollen records as a proxy for past vegetation and land cover (n = 253) and (3) proxies, such as stable isotopes, from lake, cave and marine records as indicators of hydro-climate (n = 47). Where possible, these data sets have been made spatially and temporally congruent in order to examine relationships between them statistically and graphically. Data have been aggregated or averaged for each region/sub-region and put into 200-year time windows. Archaeo-demographic data show a clear increase at the start of Neolithic farming, followed by a series of regionally asynchronous fluctuations in population, prior to a pan-Mediterranean Roman settlement maximum. Pollen data indicate a late-Holocene decline in %Arboreal Pollen in those regions that were initially well wooded, but not in drier regions of the southern/ eastern Mediterranean. Overall, the clearest palynological proxy for human land cover change is provided by the OJCV (tree crop) index. The cultivation of these trees in the eastern Mediterranean after 6500 cal. yr BP may have been an adaptive response to mid-Holocene climatic desiccation. These anthropogenic pollen indicators correlate more closely with trends in population than with regional hydro-climatic z scores, implying that they reflect primarily human activities. During the mid Holocene, most Mediterranean landscapes were transformed by a combination of climate and rural land use, but after ~3500 cal. yr BP, human actions became increasingly dominant in determining land cover. During the past 1500 years, the dominant landscape trajectory in the eastern Mediterranean was markedly different to that in the central/western Mediterranean.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Roberts","given":"Neil"},{"family":"Woodbridge","given":"Jessie"},{"family":"Palmisano","given":"Alessio"},{"family":"Bevan","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Fyfe","given":"Ralph"},{"family":"Shennan","given":"Stephen"}],"citation-key":"roberts2019MediterraneanLandscapeChange","container-title":"The Holocene","DOI":"10.1177/0959683619826697","ISSN":"0959-6836, 1477-0911","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,27]]},"language":"en","page":"095968361982669","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Mediterranean landscape change during the Holocene: Synthesis, comparison and regional trends in population, land cover and climate","title-short":"Mediterranean landscape change during the Holocene","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0959683619826697"},

  {"id":"rosenberg2001IncompleteTaxonSampling","abstract":"A major issue in all data collection for molecular phylogenetics is taxon sampling, which refers to the use of data from only a small representative set of species for inferring higher-level evolutionary history. Insufficient taxon sampling is often cited as a significant source of error in phylogenetic studies, and consequently, acquisition of large data sets is advocated. To test this assertion, we have conducted computer simulation studies by using natural collections of evolutionary parameters—rates of evolution, species sampling, and gene lengths—determined from data available in genomic databases. A comparison of the true tree with trees constructed by using taxa subsamples and trees constructed by using all taxa shows that the amount of phylogenetic error per internal branch is similar; a result that holds true for the neighbor-joining, minimum evolution, maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood methods. Furthermore, our results show that even though trees inferred by using progressively larger taxa subsamples of a real data set become increasingly similar to trees inferred by using the full sample, all inferred trees are equidistant from the true tree in terms of phylogenetic error per internal branch. Our results suggest that longer sequences, rather than extensive sampling, will better improve the accuracy of phylogenetic inference.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Rosenberg","given":"Michael S."},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Sudhir"}],"citation-key":"rosenberg2001IncompleteTaxonSampling","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.191248498","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"19","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001,9,11]]},"language":"en","page":"10751-10756","PMID":"11526218","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Biological Sciences","source":"www-pnas-org.libaccess.lib.mcmaster.ca","title":"Incomplete taxon sampling is not a problem for phylogenetic inference","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/content/98/19/10751","volume":"98"},

Using new methods based on the statistics of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) splits, we show that this interpretation is incorrect. For many species, each locus has recombined many times along its line of descent, and instead of many loci supporting a common phylogeny, the phylogeny changes many thousands of times along the genome alignment. Analysis of the patterns of allele sharing among strains shows that bacterial populations cannot be approximated as either clonal or freely recombining but are structured such that recombination rates between lineages vary over several orders of magnitude, with a unique pattern of rates for each lineage. Thus, rather than reflecting clonal ancestry, whole genome phylogenies reflect distributions of recombination rates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Sakoparnig","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Field","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Nimwegen","given":"Erik","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"sakoparnig2021WholeGenomePhylogenies","container-title":"eLife","DOI":"10.7554/eLife.65366","editor":[{"family":"Nourmohammad","given":"Armita"},{"family":"Walczak","given":"Aleksandra M"}],"ISSN":"2050-084X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,8]]},"page":"e65366","publisher":"eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd","source":"eLife","title":"Whole genome phylogenies reflect the distributions of recombination rates for many bacterial species","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.65366","volume":"10"},

Genetic studies also indicate that present-day population structure within Africa extends to deep times, paralleling a paleoenvironmental record of shifting and fractured habitable zones.

The motivation is that evolutionary inferences are often made from phylogenetic trees reconstructed from population data even though recombination may well occur (mtDNA or viral sequences) or does occur (nuclear sequences). We investigate the size and direction of biases when a single tree is reconstructed ignoring recombination. Standard software (PHYLIP) was used to construct the best phylogenetic tree from sequences simulated under the coalescent with recombination. With recombination present, the length of terminal branches and the total branch length are larger, and the time to the most recent common ancestor smaller, than for a tree reconstructed from sequences evolving with no recombination. The effects are pronounced even for small levels of recombination that may not be immediately detectable in a data set. The phylogenies when recombination is present superficially resemble phylogenies for sequences from an exponentially growing population. However, exponential growth has a different effect on statistics such as Tajima's D. Furthermore, ignoring recombination leads to a large overestimation of the substitution rate heterogeneity and the loss of the molecular clock. These results are discussed in relation to viral and mtDNA data sets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Schierup","given":"M H"},{"family":"Hein","given":"J"}],"citation-key":"schierup2000ConsequencesRecombinationTraditional","container-title":"Genetics","container-title-short":"Genetics","ISSN":"0016-6731","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000,10]]},"page":"879-891","PMCID":"PMC1461297","PMID":"11014833","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Consequences of recombination on traditional phylogenetic analysis.","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1461297/","volume":"156"},

  {"id":"schwarz2009NewInsightsOld","abstract":"Despite being plagued by heavily degraded DNA in palaeontological remains, most studies addressing the state of DNA degradation have been limited to types of damage which do not pose a hindrance to Taq polymerase during PCR. Application of serial qPCR to the two fractions obtained during extraction (demineralization and protein digest) from six permafrost mammoth bones and one partially degraded modern elephant bone has enabled further insight into the changes which endogenous DNA is subjected to during diagenesis.

In Europe, the most devastating plagues were those from the Black Death pandemic in the 1300s to the Great Plague of London in 1665. For the last 100 years, it has been accepted that Yersinia pestis, the infective agent of bubonic plague, was responsible for these epidemics. This book combines modern concepts of epidemiology and molecular biology with computer-modelling. Applying these to the analysis of historical epidemics, the authors show that they were not, in fact, outbreaks of bubonic plague. Biology of Plagues offers a completely new interdisciplinary interpretation of the plagues of Europe and establishes them within a geographical, historical and demographic framework. This fascinating detective work will be of interest to readers in the social and biological sciences, and lessons learnt will underline the implications of historical plagues for modern-day epidemiology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Scott","given":"Susan"},{"family":"Duncan","given":"Christopher J."}],"citation-key":"scott2001BiologyPlaguesEvidence","DOI":"10.1017/CBO9780511542527","event-place":"Cambridge","ISBN":"978-0-521-80150-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001]]},"publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Biology of Plagues: Evidence from Historical Populations","title-short":"Biology of Plagues","type":"book","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/biology-of-plagues/9AE9838FB1BBE059455F24C75DDB9DE2"},

  {"id":"searle2009CelticFringeBritain","abstract":"Recent genetic studies have challenged the traditional view that the ancestors of British Celtic people spread from central Europe during the Iron Age and have suggested a much earlier origin for them as part of the human recolonization of Britain at the end of the last glaciation. Here we propose that small mammals provide an analogue to help resolve this controversy. Previous studies have shown that common shrews (Sorex araneus) with particular chromosomal characteristics and water voles (Arvicola terrestris) of a specific mitochondrial (mt) DNA lineage have peripheral western/northern distributions with striking similarities to that of Celtic people. We show that mtDNA lineages of three other small mammal species (bank vole Myodes glareolus, field vole Microtus agrestis and pygmy shrew Sorex minutus) also form a ‘Celtic fringe’. We argue that these small mammals most reasonably colonized Britain in a two-phase process following the last glacial maximum (LGM), with climatically driven partial replacement of the first colonists by the second colonists, leaving a peripheral geographical distribution for the first colonists. We suggest that these natural Celtic fringes provide insight into the same phenomenon in humans and support its origin in processes following the end of the LGM.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Searle","given":"Jeremy B."},{"family":"Kotlík","given":"Petr"},{"family":"Rambau","given":"Ramugondo V."},{"family":"Marková","given":"Silvia"},{"family":"Herman","given":"Jeremy S."},{"family":"McDevitt","given":"Allan D."}],"citation-key":"searle2009CelticFringeBritain","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2009.1422","issue":"1677","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,12,22]]},"page":"4287-4294","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"The Celtic fringe of Britain: insights from small mammal phylogeography","title-short":"The Celtic fringe of Britain","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2009.1422","volume":"276"},

Here, we show that although flea-borne transmission usually leads to bubonic plague in mice, it can also lead to primary septicemic plague. However, intradermal injection of Y. pestis, commonly used to mimic transmission by fleabite, leads only to bubonic plague. A Y. pestis strain lacking the plasmid-encoded cell-surface plasminogen activator, which is avirulent by intradermal or s.c. injection, was able to cause fatal primary septicemic plague at low incidence, but not bubonic plague, when transmitted by fleas. The results clarify a long-standing uncertainty about the etiology of primary septicemic plague and support an evolutionary scenario in which plague first emerged as a flea-borne septicemic disease of limited transmissibility. Subsequent acquisition of the plasminogen activator gene by horizontal transfer enabled the bubonic form of disease and increased the potential for epidemic spread.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Sebbane","given":"Florent"},{"family":"Jarrett","given":"Clayton O."},{"family":"Gardner","given":"Donald"},{"family":"Long","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Hinnebusch","given":"B.

  {"id":"shi2018ReemergenceHumanPlague","abstract":"The third plague pandemic originated from Yunnan Province, China in the middle of the 19th century. The last human plague epidemic in Yunnan occurred from 1986–2005. On June 6, 2016, a case of human plague was reported in the Xishuangbanna Prefecture, Yunnan. The patient suffered from primary septicemic plague after exposure to a dead house rat (Rattus flavipectus), which has been identified as the main plague reservoir in the local epizootic area. Moreover, a retrospective investigation identified another bubonic plague case in this area. Based on these data, human plague reemerged after a silent period of ten years. In this study, three molecular typing methods, including a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) analysis, different region analysis (DFR), and multiple-locus variable number of tandem repeats analysis (MLVA), were used to illustrate the molecular characteristics of Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis) strains isolated in Yunnan. The DFR profiles of the strains isolated in Yunnan in 2016 were the same as the strains that had previously been isolated in this Rattus flavipectus plague focus. The c3 spacer present in the previously isolated strains was absent in the spacer arrays of the Ypc CRISPR loci of the strains isolated in 2016.

Although encompassing a large area of natural plague foci, Y. pestis strains have rarely been found in live rodents during surveillance in Yunnan, and most isolates are from rodent corpses and their fleas. In 2017, 10 Y. pestis strains were isolated from seven live rodents and three fleas in Heqing County of Yunnan. These strains were supposed to have low virulence to local rodents Eothenomys miletus and Apodemus chevrieri because the rodents were healthy and no dead animals were found in surrounding areas, as had occurred in previous epizootic disease. We performed microscopic and biochemical examinations of the isolates, and compared their whole-genome sequences and transcriptome with those of 10 high virulence Y. pestis strains that were isolated from nine rodents and one parasitic flea in adjacent city (Lijiang). We analyzed the phenotypic, genomic, and transcriptomic characteristics of live rodent isolates. The isolates formed a previously undefined monophyletic branch of Y. pestis that was named 1.IN5. Six SNPs, two indels, and one copy number variation were detected between live rodent isolates and the high virulence neighbors. No obvious functional consequence of these variations was found according to the known annotation information. Among genes which expression differential in the live rodent isolates compared to their high virulent neighbors, we found five iron transfer related ones that were significant up-regulated (| log2 (FC) | > 1, p.adjust < 0.05), indicating these genes may be related to the low-virulence phenotype. The novel genotype of Y. pestis reported here provides further insights into the evolution and spread of plague as well as clues that may help to decipher the virulence mechanism of this notorious pathogen.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Shi","given":"Liyuan"},{"family":"Qin","given":"Jingliang"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Hongyuan"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Ying"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Haipeng"},{"family":"Zhong","given":"Youhong"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Chao"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Shanshan"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Fengyi"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Yarong"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Guangyu"},{"family":"Song","given":"Yajun"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Ruifu"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Peng"},{"family":"Cui","given":"Yujun"}],"citation-key":"shi2021NewGenotypeYersinia","container-title":"Frontiers in Microbiology","DOI":"10.3389/fmicb.2021.628335","ISSN":"1664-302X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"page":"858","source":"Frontiers","title":"New Genotype of Yersinia pestis Found in Live Rodents in Yunnan Province, China","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmicb.2021.628335","volume":"12"},

Three different models are presented: one radial, one cost-based and one combining network analysis and radial propagation. Simulations were made to depict different scenarios on the spread of the disease, as well as the drastic changes in the overall population of Sweden, over a couple of hundred years. For purpose of validation the population decrease estimated in each parish is compared with independent historical documents. Results from model scenarios are visualized in maps of propagation, animated video sequences and a web map service. Our analyses clearly demonstrate the power of spatial analysis and geographic information systems to describe, model and visualize epidemiologic processes in space and time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Skog","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Hauska","given":"Hans"}],"citation-key":"skog2013SpatialModelingBlack","container-title":"Transactions in GIS","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-9671.2012.01369.x","ISSN":"1467-9671","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1467-9671.2012.01369.x","page":"589-611","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Spatial Modeling of the Black Death in Sweden","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9671.2012.01369.x","volume":"17"},
  {"id":"skoglund2013AccurateSexIdentification","abstract":"Accurate identiﬁcation of the biological sex of ancient remains is vital for critically testing hypotheses about social structure in prehistoric societies. However, morphological methods are imprecise for juvenile individuals and fragmentary remains, and molecular methods that rely on particular sex-speciﬁc marker loci such as the amelogenin gene suffer from allelic dropout and sensitivity to modern contamination. Analyzing shotgun sequencing data from 14 present-day humans of known biological sex and 16 ancient individuals from a time span of 100 to w70,000 years ago, we show that even relatively sparse shotgun sequencing (about 100,000 human sequences) can be used to reliably identify chromosomal sex simply by considering the ratio of sequences aligning to the X and Y chromosomes, and highlight two examples where the genetic assignments indicate morphological misassignment. Furthermore, we show that accurate sex identiﬁcation of highly degraded remains can be performed in the presence of substantial amounts of present-day contamination by utilizing the signature of cytosine deamination, a characteristic feature of ancient DNA.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Skoglund","given":"Pontus"},{"family":"Storå","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Götherström","given":"Anders"},{"family":"Jakobsson","given":"Mattias"}],"citation-key":"skoglund2013AccurateSexIdentification","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2013.07.004","ISSN":"03054403","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,12]]},"language":"en","page":"4477-4482","source":"Crossref","title":"Accurate sex identification of ancient human remains using DNA shotgun sequencing","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0305440313002495","volume":"40"},

Unlike the Black Death, its immediate predecessor, which seems to have originated in Central Asia, the pestis secunda emerged in Central Germany, most likely in the Frankfurt region, in summer 1356. Having seeded its new reservoir, the plague radiated from Central Germany, a landlocked region, into other parts of West Eurasia and North Africa, via inland routes. The inland mode of transmission is at odds with the geographic spread of the Black Death, whereby the plague arrived in West Eurasian and North African ports via maritime trade routes. To appreciate the appearance of the Central Germany plague reservoir in the early 1350s, the wider ecological, climatic and socio-economic context of the Frankfurt region is scrutinized, on the basis of textual, palaeoclimatic and palaeogenetic evidence. Although beyond the remit of this article, it argues that the Central German reservoir may have become the origin of recurrent late-medieval and early-modern plague outbreaks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Slavin","given":"Philip"}],"citation-key":"slavin2021OutWestFormation","container-title":"Past & Present","container-title-short":"Past & Present","DOI":"10.1093/pastj/gtaa028","ISSN":"0031-2746","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"page":"3-51","source":"Silverchair","title":"Out of the West: formation of a permanent plague reservoir in south-central Germany (1349–1356) and its implications","title-short":"Out of the West","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/pastj/gtaa028","volume":"252"},

Here, we reconstruct ancient Y. pestis genomes from individuals associated with the Late Bronze Age period (~3800 BP) in the Samara region of modern-day Russia.

All isolates solubilized high amount of phosphate and 12 of 16 strains solubilized potassium. E. faecium LB5, L. lactis LB6, LB7, and LB9 inhibited the plant pathogenic Fusarium graminearum to the same extent as two strains of Bacillus sp. However, the antifungal activity of the abovementioned LAB strains depended on the medium of cultivation and a low pH while antifungal activity of Bacillus spp. was independent of the growth medium and likely relates to antifungal lipopeptides. This study showed the potential of rhizospheric LAB for future application as biofertilizers in agriculture.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Strafella","given":"Sabrina"},{"family":"Simpson","given":"David J."},{"family":"Yaghoubi Khanghahi","given":"Mohammad"},{"family":"De Angelis","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Gänzle","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Minervini","given":"Fabio"},{"family":"Crecchio","given":"Carmine"}],"citation-key":"strafella2021ComparativeGenomicsVitro","container-title":"Microorganisms","DOI":"10.3390/microorganisms9010078","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"78","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Comparative Genomics and In Vitro Plant Growth Promotion and Biocontrol Traits of Lactic Acid Bacteria from the Wheat Rhizosphere","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/9/1/78","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"strayer2017BoombustDynamicsBiological","abstract":"Boom-bust dynamics - the rise of a population to outbreak levels, followed by a dramatic decline - have been associated with biological invasions and offered as a reason not to manage troublesome invaders. However, boom-bust dynamics rarely have been critically defined, analyzed, or interpreted. Here, we define boom-bust dynamics and provide specific suggestions for improving the application of the boom-bust concept. Boom-bust dynamics can arise from many causes, some closely associated with invasions, but others occurring across a wide range of ecological settings, especially when environmental conditions are changing rapidly. As a result, it is difficult to infer cause or predict future trajectories merely by observing the dynamic. We use tests with simulated data to show that a common metric for detecting and describing boom-bust dynamics, decline from an observed peak to a subsequent trough, tends to severely overestimate the frequency and severity of busts, and should be used cautiously if at all. We review and test other metrics that are better suited to describe boom-bust dynamics. Understanding the frequency and importance of boom-bust dynamics requires empirical studies of large, representative, long-term data sets that use clear definitions of boom-bust, appropriate analytical methods, and careful interpretations.","author":[{"family":"Strayer","given":"David L."},{"family":"D'Antonio","given":"Carla M."},{"family":"Essl","given":"Franz"},{"family":"Fowler","given":"Mike S."},{"family":"Geist","given":"Juergen"},{"family":"Hilt","given":"Sabine"},{"family":"Jarić","given":"Ivan"},{"family":"Jöhnk","given":"Klaus"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Clive G."},{"family":"Lambin","given":"Xavier"},{"family":"Latzka","given":"Alexander W."},{"family":"Pergl","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Pyšek","given":"Petr"},{"family":"Robertson","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Schmalensee","given":"Menja","non-dropping-particle":"von"},{"family":"Stefansson","given":"Robert A."},{"family":"Wright","given":"Justin"},{"family":"Jeschke","given":"Jonathan M."}],"citation-key":"strayer2017BoombustDynamicsBiological","container-title":"Ecology Letters","container-title-short":"Ecol Lett","DOI":"10.1111/ele.12822","ISSN":"1461-0248","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,10]]},"language":"eng","page":"1337-1350","PMID":"28834087","source":"PubMed","title":"Boom-bust dynamics in biological invasions: towards an improved application of the concept","title-short":"Boom-bust dynamics in biological invasions","type":"article-journal","volume":"20"},

In this study, we explored spatiotemporal clusters of human plague occurrences in China using a machine‐learning clustering method, and reconstructed the potential transmission pattern during the Third Pandemic (1772–1964). We succeeded to identify 6 clusters in space domain (2‐Dimension) and 13 clusters in spatiotemporal domain (3‐Dimension). Our results suggest that plague in different spatial clusters experienced several temporal outbreaks and transmissions.

  {"id":"susat2020YersiniaPestisStrains","abstract":"Ancient genomic studies have identified Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis) as the causative agent of the second plague pandemic (fourteenth–eighteenth century) that started with the Black Death (1,347–1,353). Most of the Y. pestis strains investigated from this pandemic have been isolated from western Europe, and not much is known about the diversity and microevolution of this bacterium in eastern European countries. In this study, we investigated human remains excavated from two cemeteries in Riga (Latvia). Historical evidence suggests that the burials were a consequence of plague outbreaks during the seventeenth century. DNA was extracted from teeth of 16 individuals and subjected to shotgun sequencing. Analysis of the metagenomic data revealed the presence of Y. pestis sequences in four remains, confirming that the buried individuals were victims of plague. In two samples, Y. pestis DNA coverage was sufficient for genome reconstruction. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis showed that the Riga strains fell within the diversity of the already known post-Black Death genomes. Interestingly, the two Latvian isolates did not cluster together. Moreover, we detected a drop in coverage of the pPCP1 plasmid region containing the pla gene. Further analysis indicated the presence of two pPCP1 plasmids, one with and one without the pla gene region, and only one bacterial chromosome, indicating that the same bacterium carried two distinct pPCP1 plasmids. In addition, we found the same pattern in the majority of previously published post-Black Death strains, but not in the Black Death strains. The pla gene is an important virulence factor for the infection of and transmission in humans. Thus, the spread of pla-depleted strains may, among other causes, have contributed to the disappearance of the second plague pandemic in eighteenth century Europe.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Susat","given":"Julian"},{"family":"Bonczarowska","given":"Joanna H."},{"family":"Pētersone-Gordina","given":"Elīna"},{"family":"Immel","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Nebel","given":"Almut"},{"family":"Gerhards","given":"Guntis"},{"family":"Krause-Kyora","given":"Ben"}],"citation-key":"susat2020YersiniaPestisStrains","container-title":"Scientific Reports","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-020-71530-9","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,3]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"14628","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"<i>Yersinia pestis</i> strains from Latvia show depletion of the pla virulence gene at the end of the second plague pandemic","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-71530-9","volume":"10"},

One of these, the 'LNBA lineage' (Late Neolithic and Bronze Age), has been suggested to have spread into Central Europe with human groups expanding from the Eurasian steppes. Here, we show that LNBA plague was spread to Europe's northwestern periphery by sequencing Yersinia pestis genomes from two individuals dating to ~4,000 cal BP from an unusual mass burial context in Somerset, England, UK. This represents the earliest evidence of plague in Britain documented to date. These British Yersinia pestis genomes belong to a sublineage previously observed in two Bronze Age individuals from Central Europe that had lost the putative virulence factor yapC. This sublineage is later found in Central Asia ~3,600 BP.

These data have revealed the emergence of lineages with mutations associated to transmissibility and antigenicity, known as variants of concern (VOCs). A striking aspect of VOCs is that many of them involve an unusually large number of defining mutations. Current phylogenetic estimates of the substitution rate of SARS-CoV-2 suggest that its genome accrues around 2 mutations per month. However, VOCs can have 15 or more defining mutations and it is hypothesized that they emerged over the course of a few months, implying that they must have evolved faster for a period of time. We analysed genome sequence data from the GISAID database to assess whether the emergence of VOCs can be attributed to changes in the substitution rate of the virus and whether this pattern can be detected at a phylogenetic level using genome data. We fit a range of molecular clock models and assessed their statistical performance. Our analyses indicate that the emergence of VOCs is driven by an episodic increase in the substitution rate of around 4-fold the background phylogenetic rate estimate that may have lasted several weeks or months. These results underscore the importance of monitoring the molecular evolution of the virus as a means of understanding the circumstances under which VOCs may emerge.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Tay","given":"John H"},{"family":"Porter","given":"Ashleigh F"},{"family":"Wirth","given":"Wytamma"},{"family":"Duchene","given":"Sebastian"}],"citation-key":"tay2022EmergenceSARSCoV2Variants","container-title":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1093/molbev/msac013","ISSN":"1537-1719","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,17]]},"page":"msac013","source":"Silverchair","title":"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern is driven by acceleration of the substitution rate","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msac013"},

  {"id":"tortoli2017NewPhylogenyGenus","abstract":"Background: Phylogenetic studies of bacteria have been based so far either on a single gene (usually the 16S rRNA) or on concatenated housekeeping genes. For what concerns the genus Mycobacterium these approaches support the separation of rapidly and slowly growing species and the clustering of most species in well-deﬁned phylogenetic groups. The advent of high-throughput shotgun sequencing leads us to revise conventional taxonomy of mycobacteria on the light of genomic data. For this purpose we investigated 88 newly sequenced species in addition to 60 retrieved from GenBank and used the Average Nucleotide Identity pairwise scores to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships within this genus.\nResults: Our analysis conﬁrmed the separation of slow and rapid growers and the intermediate position occupied by the M. terrae complex. Among the rapid growers, the species of the M. chelonae-abscessus complex belonged to the most ancestral cluster. Other major clades of rapid growers included the species related to M. fortuitum and M. smegmatis and a large grouping containing mostly environmental species rarely isolated from humans. The members of the M. terrae complex appeared as the most ancestral slow growers. Among slow growers two deep branches led to the clusters of species related to M. celatum and M. xenopi and to a large group harboring most of the species more frequently responsible of disease in humans, including the major pathogenic mycobacteria (M. tuberculosis, M. leprae, M. ulcerans). The species previously grouped in the M. simiae complex were allocated in a number of sub-clades; of them, only the one including the species M. simiae identiﬁed the real members of this complex. The other clades included also species previously not considered related to M. simiae. The ANI analysis, in most cases supported by Genome to Genome Distance and by Genomic Signature-Delta Diﬀerence, showed that a number of species with standing in literature were indeed synonymous.\nConclusions: Genomic data revealed to be much more informative in comparison with phenotype. We believe that the genomic revolution enabled by high-throughput shotgun sequencing should now be considered in order to revise the conservative approaches still informing taxonomic sciences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Tortoli","given":"Enrico"},{"family":"Fedrizzi","given":"Tarcisio"},{"family":"Meehan","given":"Conor J."},{"family":"Trovato","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Grottola","given":"Antonella"},{"family":"Giacobazzi","given":"Elisabetta"},{"family":"Serpini","given":"Giulia Fregni"},{"family":"Tagliazucchi","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Fabio","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Bettua","given":"Clotilde"},{"family":"Bertorelli","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Frascaro","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"De Sanctis","given":"Veronica"},{"family":"Pecorari","given":"Monica"},{"family":"Jousson","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Segata","given":"Nicola"},{"family":"Cirillo","given":"Daniela M."}],"citation-key":"tortoli2017NewPhylogenyGenus","container-title":"Infection, Genetics and Evolution","DOI":"10.1016/j.meegid.2017.10.013","ISSN":"15671348","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,12]]},"language":"en","page":"19-25","source":"Crossref","title":"The new phylogeny of the genus Mycobacterium : The old and the news","title-short":"The new phylogeny of the genus Mycobacterium","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1567134817303519","volume":"56"},

Sixty-four unique strains were cultured from ticks collected in southern Canada and the genomes sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of the chromosome revealed two large clades with multiple subclades. Consistent with previous studies on this species, the clades were not geographically defined, and some Canadian strains were highly divergent from previously sequenced US strains. There was evidence for recombination in the chromosome but this did not affect the phylogeny. Analysis of chromosomal genes indicated that these are under intense purifying selection. Phylogenies of the accessory genome and chromosome were congruent.

  {"id":"uhlemann2017EvolutionaryDynamicsPandemic","abstract":"Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) accounts for the majority of S. aureus infections globally, and yet surprisingly little is known about its clonal evolution. We applied comparative whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analyses to epidemiologically and geographically diverse ST398-MSSA, a pandemic lineage affecting both humans and livestock. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis predicted divergence of human-associated ST398-MSSA ~40 years ago. Isolates from Midwestern pigs and veterinarians differed substantially from those in New York City (NYC). Pig ST398 strains contained a large region of recombination representing imports from multiple sequence types (STs). Phylogeographic analyses supported the spread of ST398-MSSA along local cultural and migratory links between parts of the Caribbean, North America, and France, respectively. Applying pairwise single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) distances as a measure of genetic relatedness between isolates, we observed that ST398 not only clustered in households but also frequently extended across local social networks. Isolates collected from environmental surfaces reflected the full diversity of colonizing individuals, highlighting their potentially critical role as reservoirs for transmission and diversification. Strikingly, we observed high within-host SNP variability compared to our previous studies on the dominant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clone USA300. Our data indicate that the dynamics of colonization, persistence, and transmission differ substantially between USA300-MRSA and ST398-MSSA. Taken together, our study reveals local and international routes of transmission for a major MSSA clone, indicating key impacts of recombination and mutation on genetic diversification and highlighting important ecological differences from epidemic USA300. Our study demonstrates extensive local and international routes of transmission for a major MSSA clone despite the lack of substantial antibiotic resistance.\nIMPORTANCE Unlike methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), surprisingly little is known about the clonal evolution of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), although these strains account for the majority of S. aureus infections. To better understand how MSSA spreads and becomes established in communities, we applied comparative bacterial whole-genome sequencing to pandemic ST398-MSSA, a clone of clinical importance affecting humans and livestock in different geographic regions. Phylogeographic analyses identified that ST398-MSSA spread along local cultural and migratory links between parts of the Caribbean, North America, and France, respectively.

Many critical issues for disease control, such as understanding the mode of transmission and identifying source reservoirs of M. ulcerans, are still largely unknown. Here, we used genomics to reconstruct in detail the evolutionary trajectory and dynamics of M. ulcerans populations at a central African scale and at smaller geographical village scales. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data were analyzed from 179 M. ulcerans strains isolated from all Buruli ulcer foci in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, The Republic of Congo, and Angola that have ever yielded positive M. ulcerans cultures. We used both temporal associations and the study of the mycobacterial demographic history to estimate the contribution of humans as a reservoir in Buruli ulcer transmission. Our phylogeographic analysis revealed one almost exclusively predominant sublineage of M. ulcerans that arose in Central Africa and proliferated in its different regions of endemicity during the Age of Discovery. We observed how the best sampled endemic hot spot, the Songololo territory, became an area of endemicity while the region was being colonized by Belgium (1880s). We furthermore identiﬁed temporal parallels between the observed past population ﬂuxes of M. ulcerans from the Songololo territory and the timing of health policy changes toward control of the Buruli ulcer epidemic in that region. These ﬁndings suggest that an intervention based on detecting and treating human cases in an area of endemicity might be sufﬁcient to break disease transmission chains, irrespective of other reservoirs of the bacterium.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Vandelannoote","given":"Koen"},{"family":"Phanzu","given":"Delphin Mavinga"},{"family":"Kibadi","given":"Kapay"},{"family":"Eddyani","given":"Miriam"},{"family":"Meehan","given":"Conor J."},{"family":"Jordaens","given":"Kurt"},{"family":"Leirs","given":"Herwig"},{"family":"Portaels","given":"Françoise"},{"family":"Stinear","given":"Timothy P."},{"family":"Harris","given":"Simon R."},{"family":"Jong","given":"Bouke C.","non-dropping-particle":"de"}],"citation-key":"vandelannoote2019MycobacteriumUlceransPopulation","container-title":"mSphere","DOI":"10.1128/mSphere.00472-18","editor":[{"family":"Limbago","given":"Brandi M."}],"ISSN":"2379-5042","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,6]]},"language":"en","source":"Crossref","title":"<i>Mycobacterium ulcerans</i> Population Genomics To Inform on the Spread of Buruli Ulcer across Central Africa","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://msphere.asm.org/lookup/doi/10.1128/mSphere.00472-18","volume":"4"},

All 411 strains were assigned to a single monophyletic clade within the 1.ORI population, indicating a single Y. pestis introduction was responsible for the successful establishment of endemic foci in Brazil. There was a moderate level of genomic diversity but little population structure among the 411 Brazilian Y. pestis strains, consistent with a radial expansion wherein Y. pestis spread rapidly from the coast to the interior of Brazil and became ecologically established. Overall, there were no strong spatial or temporal patterns among the Brazilian strains. However, strains from the same focus tended to be more closely related and strains isolated from foci closer to the coast tended to fall in more basal positions in the whole genome phylogeny than strains from more interior foci.

  {"id":"volz2013InferringSourceTransmission","abstract":"Identifying the source of transmission using pathogen genetic data is complicated by numerous biological, immunological, and behavioral factors. A large source of error arises when there is incomplete or sparse sampling of cases. Unsampled cases may act as either a common source of infection or as an intermediary in a transmission chain for hosts infected with genetically similar pathogens. It is difficult to quantify the probability of common source or intermediate transmission events, which has made it difficult to develop statistical tests to either confirm or deny putative transmission pairs with genetic data. We present a method to incorporate additional information about an infectious disease epidemic, such as incidence and prevalence of infection over time, to inform estimates of the probability that one sampled host is the direct source of infection of another host in a pathogen gene genealogy. These methods enable forensic applications, such as source-case attribution, for infectious disease epidemics with incomplete sampling, which is usually the case for high-morbidity community-acquired pathogens like HIV, Influenza and Dengue virus. These methods also enable epidemiological applications such as the identification of factors that increase the risk of transmission. We demonstrate these methods in the context of the HIV epidemic in Detroit, Michigan, and we evaluate the suitability of current sequence databases for forensic and epidemiological investigations. We find that currently available sequences collected for drug resistance testing of HIV are unlikely to be useful in most forensic investigations, but are useful for identifying transmission risk factors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Volz","given":"Erik M."},{"family":"Frost","given":"Simon D.

  {"id":"volz2020IdentificationHiddenPopulation","abstract":"Population structure influences genealogical patterns, however, data pertaining to how populations are structured are often unavailable or not directly observable. Inference of population structure is highly important in molecular epidemiology where pathogen phylogenetics is increasingly used to infer transmission patterns and detect outbreaks. Discrepancies between observed and idealized genealogies, such as those generated by the coalescent process, can be quantified, and where significant differences occur, may reveal the action of natural selection, host population structure, or other demographic and epidemiological heterogeneities. We have developed a fast non-parametric statistical test for detection of cryptic population structure in time-scaled phylogenetic trees. The test is based on contrasting estimated phylogenies with the theoretically expected phylodynamic ordering of common ancestors in two clades within a coalescent framework. These statistical tests have also motivated the development of algorithms which can be used to quickly screen a phylogenetic tree for clades which are likely to share a distinct demographic or epidemiological history. Epidemiological applications include identification of outbreaks in vulnerable host populations or rapid expansion of genotypes with a fitness advantage. To demonstrate the utility of these methods for outbreak detection, we applied the new methods to large phylogenies reconstructed from thousands of HIV-1 partial pol sequences. This revealed the presence of clades which had grown rapidly in the recent past and was significantly concentrated in young men, suggesting recent and rapid transmission in that group. Furthermore, to demonstrate the utility of these methods for the study of antimicrobial resistance, we applied the new methods to a large phylogeny reconstructed from whole genome Neisseria gonorrhoeae sequences. We find that population structure detected using these methods closely overlaps with the appearance and expansion of mutations conferring antimicrobial resistance.

  {"id":"white2020ModelingJustinianicPlague","abstract":"The Justinianic Plague, the first part of the earliest of the three plague pandemics, has minimal historical documentation. Based on the limited primary sources, historians have argued both for and against the \"maximalist narrative\" of plague, i.e. that the Justinianic Plague had universally devastating effects throughout the Mediterranean region during the sixth century CE. Using primary sources of one of the pandemic’s best documented outbreaks that took place in Constantinople during 542 CE, as well as modern findings on plague etiology and epidemiology, we developed a series of dynamic, compartmental models of disease to explore which, if any, transmission routes of plague are feasible. Using expected parameter values, we find that the bubonic and bubonic-pneumonic transmission routes exceed maximalist mortality estimates and are of shorter detectable duration than described by the primary sources. When accounting for parameter uncertainty, several of the bubonic plague model configurations yielded interquartile estimates consistent with the upper end of maximalist estimates of mortality; however, these models had shorter detectable outbreaks than suggested by the primary sources. The pneumonic transmission routes suggest that by itself, pneumonic plague would not cause significant mortality in the city. However, our global sensitivity analysis shows that predicted disease dynamics vary widely for all hypothesized transmission routes, suggesting that regardless of its effects in Constantinople, the Justinianic Plague would have likely had differential effects across urban areas around the Mediterranean. Our work highlights the uncertainty surrounding the details in the primary sources on the Justinianic Plague and calls into question the likelihood that the Justinianic Plague affected all localities in the same way.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,15]]},"author":[{"family":"White","given":"Lauren A."},{"family":"Mordechai","given":"Lee"}],"citation-key":"white2020ModelingJustinianicPlague","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0231256","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,30]]},"language":"en","page":"e0231256","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Modeling the Justinianic Plague: Comparing hypothesized transmission routes","title-short":"Modeling the Justinianic Plague","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0231256","volume":"15"},

Here, we performed whole genome sequencing of outbreak-associated isolates to produce the largest population analysis to date of Y. pseudotuberculosis, giving us unprecedented capacity to understand the emergence and evolution of the outbreak clone. Multivariate analysis incorporating our genomic and clinical epidemiological data strongly suggested a single point-source contamination of the food chain, with subsequent nationwide distribution of contaminated produce. We additionally uncovered significant diversity in key determinants of virulence, which we speculate may help explain the high morbidity linked to this outbreak.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Williamson","given":"Deborah A."},{"family":"Baines","given":"Sarah L."},{"family":"Carter","given":"Glen P."},{"family":"Silva","given":"Anders Gonçalves","non-dropping-particle":"da"},{"family":"Ren","given":"Xiaoyun"},{"family":"Sherwood","given":"Jill"},{"family":"Dufour","given":"Muriel"},{"family":"Schultz","given":"Mark B."},{"family":"French","given":"Nigel P."},{"family":"Seemann","given":"Torsten"},{"family":"Stinear","given":"Timothy P."},{"family":"Howden","given":"Benjamin P."}],"citation-key":"williamson2016GenomicInsightsSustained","container-title":"Genome Biology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Genome Biology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1093/gbe/evw285","ISSN":"1759-6653","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,12,1]]},"page":"3806-3814","source":"Silverchair","title":"Genomic Insights into a Sustained National Outbreak of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evw285","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"woodbridge2019PolleninferredRegionalVegetation","abstract":"Southern Anatolia is a highly significant area within the Mediterranean, particularly in terms of understanding how agriculture moved into Europe from neighbouring regions. This study uses pollen, palaeoclimate and archaeological evidence to investigate the relationships between demography and vegetation change, and to explore how the development of agriculture varied spatially. Data from 21 fossil pollen records have been transformed into forested, parkland and open vegetation types using cluster analysis. Patterns of change have been explored using non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) and through analysis of indicator groups, such as an Anthropogenic Pollen Index, and Simpson’s Diversity. Settlement data, which indicate population densities, and summed radiocarbon dates for archaeological sites have been used as a proxy for demographic change. The pollen and archaeological records confirm that farming can be detected earlier in Anatolia in comparison with many other parts of the Mediterranean. Dynamics of change in grazing indicators and the OJCV (Olea, Juglans, Castanea and Vitis) index for cultivated trees appear to match cycles of population expansion and decline. Vegetation and land use change is also influenced by other factors, such as climate change. Investigating the early impacts of anthropogenic activities (e.g. woodcutting, animal herding, the use of fire and agriculture) is key to understanding how societies have modified the environment since the mid–late Holocene, despite the capacity of ecological systems to absorb recurrent disturbances. The results of this study suggest that shifting human population dynamics played an important role in shaping land cover in central and southern Anatolia.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Woodbridge","given":"Jessie"},{"family":"Roberts","given":"C Neil"},{"family":"Palmisano","given":"Alessio"},{"family":"Bevan","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Shennan","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Fyfe","given":"Ralph"},{"family":"Eastwood","given":"Warren J"},{"family":"Izdebski","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Çakırlar","given":"Canan"},{"family":"Woldring","given":"Henk"},{"family":"Broothaerts","given":"Nils"},{"family":"Kaniewski","given":"David"},{"family":"Finné","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Labuhn","given":"Inga"}],"citation-key":"woodbridge2019PolleninferredRegionalVegetation","container-title":"The Holocene","DOI":"10.1177/0959683619826635","ISSN":"0959-6836, 1477-0911","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,13]]},"language":"en","page":"095968361982663","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Pollen-inferred regional vegetation patterns and demographic change in Southern Anatolia through the Holocene","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0959683619826635"},
  {"id":"worldhealthorganizationClassificationOmicron529","abstract":"The Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution (TAG-VE) is an independent group of experts that periodically monitors and evaluates the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and assesses if specific mutations and combinations of mutations alter the behaviour of the virus. The TAG-VE was convened on 26 November 2021 to assess the SARS-CoV-2 variant: B.1.1.529. The B.1.1.529 variant was first reported to WHO from South Africa on 24 November 2021. The epidemiological situation in South Africa has been characterized by three distinct peaks in reported cases, the latest of which was predominantly the Delta variant. In recent weeks, infections have increased steeply, coinciding with the detection of B.1.1.529 variant. The first known confirmed B.1.1.529 infection was from a specimen collected on 9 November 2021. This variant has a large number of mutations, some of which are concerning. Preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant, as compared to other VOCs. The number of cases of this variant appears to be increasing in almost all provinces in South Africa. Current SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostics continue to detect this variant. Several labs have indicated that for one widely used PCR test, one of the three target genes is not detected (called S gene dropout or S gene target failure) and this test can therefore be used as marker for this variant, pending sequencing confirmation. Using this approach, this variant has been detected at faster rates than previous surges in infection, suggesting that this variant may have a growth advantage.There are a number of studies underway and the TAG-VE will continue to evaluate this variant. WHO will communicate new findings with Member States and to the public as needed.Based on the evidence presented indicative of a detrimental change in COVID-19 epidemiology, the TAG-VE has advised WHO that this variant should be designated as a VOC, and the WHO has designated B.1.1.529 as a VOC, named Omicron. As such, countries are asked to do the following: enhance surveillance and sequencing efforts to better understand circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants.submit complete genome sequences and associated metadata to a publicly available database, such as GISAID. report initial cases/clusters associated with VOC infection to WHO through the IHR mechanism. where capacity exists and in coordination with the international community, perform field investigations and laboratory assessments to improve understanding of the potential impacts of the VOC on COVID-19 epidemiology, severity, effectiveness of public health and social measures, diagnostic methods, immune responses, antibody neutralization, or other relevant characteristics.Individuals are reminded to take measures to reduce their risk of COVID-19, including proven public health and social measures such as wearing well-fitting masks, hand hygiene, physical distancing, improving ventilation of indoor spaces, avoiding crowded spaces, and getting vaccinated.For reference, WHO has working definitions for SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Interest (VOI) and Variant of Concern (VOC). A SARS-CoV-2 VOI is a SARS-CoV-2 variant: with genetic changes that are predicted or known to affect virus characteristics such as transmissibility, disease severity, immune escape, diagnostic or therapeutic escape; AND that has been identified as causing significant community transmission or multiple COVID-19 clusters, in multiple countries with increasing relative prevalence alongside increasing number of cases over time, or other apparent epidemiological impacts to suggest an emerging risk to global public health.  A SARS-CoV-2 VOC is a SARS-CoV-2 variant that meets the definition of a VOI (see above) and, through a comparative assessment, has been demonstrated to be associated with one or more of the following changes at a degree of global public health significance: increase in transmissibility or detrimental change in COVID-19 epidemiology; ORincrease in virulence or change in clinical disease presentation; ORdecrease in effectiveness of public health and social measures or available diagnostics, vaccines, therapeutics","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,18]]},"author":[{"family":"World Health Organization","given":""}],"citation-key":"worldhealthorganizationClassificationOmicron529","language":"en","title":"Classification of Omicron (B.1.1.529): SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern","title-short":"Classification of Omicron (B.1.1.529)","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.who.int/news/item/26-11-2021-classification-of-omicron-(b.1.1.529)-sars-cov-2-variant-of-concern"},

By using an extensive dataset consisting of date and location of cases for the third plague pandemic from 1772 to 1964 in China and a novel method (nearest neighbour approach) which deals with both short- and long-distance transmissions, we found the presence of major roads, rivers and coastline accelerated the spread of plague and shaped the transmission patterns. We found that plague spread velocity was positively associated with wet conditions (measured by an index of drought and flood events) in China, probably due to flood-driven transmission by people or rodents. Our study provides new insights on transmission patterns and possible mechanisms behind variability in transmission speed, with implications for prevention and control measures.

Here, we show that two lineages, 2.MED and 1.ORI3, spread significantly faster than others, possibly reflecting differences among strains in transmission mechanisms and virulence. Plague spread fastest in regions with low population density and high proportion of pasture- or forestland, findings that should be taken into account for effective plague monitoring and control. Temperature exhibited a nonlinear, U-shaped association with spread speed, with a minimum around 20 °C, while precipitation showed a positive association.

Here, we resolve the hypothetical role of trade routes through statistical analysis on the geo-referenced major trade routes in the early modern period and the 6,656 geo-referenced plague outbreak records in AD1347–1760. Ordinary Least Square (OLS) estimation results show that major trade routes played a dominant role in spreading plague in pre-industrial Europe. Furthermore, the negative correlation between plague outbreaks and their distance from major trade ports indicates the absence of a permanent plague focus in the inland areas of Europe. Major trade routes decided the major plague outbreak hotspots, while navigable rivers determined the geographic pattern of sporadic plague cases. A case study in Germany indicates that plague penetrated further into Europe through the local trade route network. Based on our findings, we propose the mechanism of plague transmission in historical Europe, which is imperative in demonstrating how pandemics were spread in recent human history.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Yue","given":"Ricci P.

  {"id":"zankari2012IdentificationAcquiredAntimicrobial","abstract":"Objectives: Identiﬁcation of antimicrobial resistance genes is important for understanding the underlying mechanisms and the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance. As the costs of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) continue to decline, it becomes increasingly available in routine diagnostic laboratories and is anticipated to substitute traditional methods for resistance gene identiﬁcation. Thus, the current challenge is to extract the relevant information from the large amount of generated data.\nMethods: We developed a web-based method, ResFinder that uses BLAST for identiﬁcation of acquired antimicrobial resistance genes in whole-genome data. As input, the method can use both pre-assembled, complete or partial genomes, and short sequence reads from four different sequencing platforms. The method was evaluated on 1862 GenBank ﬁles containing 1411 different resistance genes, as well as on 23 de-novo-sequenced isolates.\nResults: When testing the 1862 GenBank ﬁles, the method identiﬁed the resistance genes with an ID¼100% (100% identity) to the genes in ResFinder. Agreement between in silico predictions and phenotypic testing was found when the method was further tested on 23 isolates of ﬁve different bacterial species, with available phenotypes. Furthermore, ResFinder was evaluated on WGS chromosomes and plasmids of 30 isolates. Seven of these isolates were annotated to have antimicrobial resistance, and in all cases, annotations were compatible with the ResFinder results.\nConclusions: A web server providing a convenient way of identifying acquired antimicrobial resistance genes in completely sequenced isolates was created. ResFinder can be accessed at www.genomicepidemiology.org.

  {"id":"zeppelini2016ZoonosesEcologicalEntities","abstract":"As a zoonosis, Plague is also an ecological entity, a complex system of ecological interactions between the pathogen, the hosts, and the spatiotemporal variations of its ecosystems. Five reservoir system models have been proposed: (i) assemblages of small mammals with different levels of susceptibility and roles in the maintenance and amplification of the cycle; (ii) species-specific chronic infection models; (ii) flea vectors as the true reservoirs; (iii) Telluric Plague, and (iv) a metapopulation arrangement for species with a discrete spatial organization, following a source-sink dynamic of extinction and recolonization with naïve potential hosts. The diversity of the community that harbors the reservoir system affects the transmission cycle by predation, competition, and dilution effect. Plague has notable environmental constraints, depending on altitude (500+ meters), warm and dry climates, and conditions for high productivity events for expansion of the transmission cycle. Human impacts are altering Plague dynamics by altering landscape and the faunal composition of the foci and adjacent areas, usually increasing the presence and number of human cases and outbreaks. Climatic change is also affecting the range of its occurrence. In the current transitional state of zoonosis as a whole, Plague is at risk of becoming a public health problem in poor countries where ecosystem erosion, anthropic invasion of new areas, and climate change increase the contact of the population with reservoir systems, giving new urgency for ecologic research that further details its maintenance in the wild, the spillover events, and how it links to human cases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Zeppelini","given":"Caio Graco"},{"family":"Almeida","given":"Alzira Maria Paiva","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Cordeiro-Estrela","given":"Pedro"}],"citation-key":"zeppelini2016ZoonosesEcologicalEntities","container-title":"PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases","container-title-short":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pntd.0004949","ISSN":"1935-2727","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"page":"e0004949","PMCID":"PMC5053604","PMID":"27711205","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Zoonoses As Ecological Entities: A Case Review of Plague","title-short":"Zoonoses As Ecological Entities","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5053604/","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"zeppelini2018OngoingQuiescenceBorborema","abstract":"Plague is a zoonosis caused by Yersinia pestis, whose cycle is based on a reservoir system composed of mammals and their fleas. Its transmission cycle presents long enzootic periods with undetected cases, sometimes misleading that the cycle is extinct. While surveillance activities in Brazil are being carried out only in some focal areas, the serologic results confirm the persistence of Y. pestis in all monitored areas. We studied the small mammal assembly and Y. pestis presencein the Borborema Plateau Focus within the state of Paraíba, which staged the last Brazilian plague outbreak (1986-1987), through aninventory and Y. pestis detection survey of small mammals in peridomestic and sylvatic areas from two municipalities in the state of Paraíba.The field sampling captured 45 specimens (27 marsupials, 18 rodents), of 10 species. Only two species (one marsupial, one rodent) were captured in both peridomestic and sylvatic ecotopes. The sylvatic ecotope had higher richness and abundance. No evidence of circulation of the pathogen was detected, however, this result does not discard the necessity of continuous epidemiological surveillance due to the risk of rekindling the foci after long dormant periods, especially given the current epidemiological transition occurring on a Global scale.","author":[{"family":"Zeppelini","given":"Caio G."},{"family":"DE Almeida","given":"Alzira M.

  {"id":"zetner2017PlasmidProfilerComparative","abstract":"Summary Comparative analysis of bacterial plasmids from whole genome sequence (WGS) data generated from short read sequencing is challenging. This is due to the difficulty in identifying contigs harbouring plasmid sequence data, and further difficulty in assembling such contigs into a full plasmid. As such, few software programs and bioinformatics pipelines exist to perform comprehensive comparative analyses of plasmids within and amongst sequenced isolates. To address this gap, we have developed Plasmid Profiler, a pipeline to perform comparative plasmid content analysis without the need for de novo assembly. The pipeline is designed to rapidly identify plasmid sequences by mapping reads to a plasmid reference sequence database. Predicted plasmid sequences are then annotated with their incompatibility group, if known. The pipeline allows users to query plasmids for genes or regions of interest and visualize results as an interactive heat map.\nAvailability and Implementation Plasmid Profiler is freely available software released under the Apache 2.0 open source software license. A stand-alone version of the entire Plasmid Profiler pipeline is available as a Docker container at https://hub.docker.com/r/phacnml/plasmidprofiler_0_1_6/.The conda recipe for the Plasmid R package is available at: https://anaconda.org/bioconda/r-plasmidprofilerThe custom Plasmid Profiler R package is also available as a CRAN package at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Plasmidprofiler/index.htmlGalaxy tools associated with the pipeline are available as a Galaxy tool suite at https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repository?repository_id=55e082200d16a504The source code is available at: https://github.com/phac-nml/plasmidprofilerThe Galaxy implementation is available at: https://github.com/phac-nml/plasmidprofiler-galaxy\nContact Email: gary.vandomselaar{at}canada.caAddress: National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada, 1015 Arlington Street, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Zetner","given":"Adrian"},{"family":"Cabral","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Mataseje","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Knox","given":"Natalie C."},{"family":"Mabon","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Mulvey","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Domselaar","given":"Gary Van"}],"citation-key":"zetner2017PlasmidProfilerComparative","DOI":"10.1101/121350","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,28]]},"language":"en","page":"121350","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","section":"New Results","source":"bioRxiv","title":"Plasmid Profiler: Comparative Analysis of Plasmid Content in WGS Data","title-short":"Plasmid Profiler","type":"article","URL":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/121350v2"},

  {"id":"zhou2020EnteroBaseUserGuide","abstract":"EnteroBase is an integrated software environment that supports the identification of global population structures within several bacterial genera that include pathogens. Here, we provide an overview of how EnteroBase works, what it can do, and its future prospects. EnteroBase has currently assembled more than 300,000 genomes from Illumina short reads from Salmonella, Escherichia, Yersinia, Clostridioides, Helicobacter, Vibrio, and Moraxella and genotyped those assemblies by core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST). Hierarchical clustering of cgMLST sequence types allows mapping a new bacterial strain to predefined population structures at multiple levels of resolution within a few hours after uploading its short reads. Case Study 1 illustrates this process for local transmissions of Salmonella enterica serovar Agama between neighboring social groups of badgers and humans. EnteroBase also supports single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calls from both genomic assemblies and after extraction from metagenomic sequences, as illustrated by Case Study 2 which summarizes the microevolution of Yersinia pestis over the last 5000 years of pandemic plague. EnteroBase can also provide a global overview of the genomic diversity within an entire genus, as illustrated by Case Study 3, which presents a novel, global overview of the population structure of all of the species, subspecies, and clades within Escherichia.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhou","given":"Zhemin"},{"family":"Alikhan","given":"Nabil-Fareed"},{"family":"Mohamed","given":"Khaled"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Yulei"},{"family":"Achtman","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"zhou2020EnteroBaseUserGuide","container-title":"Genome Research","container-title-short":"Genome Res","DOI":"10.1101/gr.251678.119","ISSN":"1088-9051","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,1]]},"page":"138-152","PMCID":"PMC6961584","PMID":"31809257","source":"PubMed Central","title":"The EnteroBase user's guide, with case studies on Salmonella transmissions, Yersinia pestis phylogeny, and Escherichia core genomic diversity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6961584/","volume":"30"},

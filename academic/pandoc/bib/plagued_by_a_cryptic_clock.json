  {"id":"andradesvaltuena2017StoneAgePlague","abstract":"Yersinia pestis, the etiologic agent of plague, is a bacterium associated with wild rodents and their fleas. Historically it was responsible for three pandemics: the Plague of Justinian in the 6th century AD, which persisted until the 8th century [1]; the renowned Black Death of the 14th century [2, 3], with recurrent outbreaks until the 18th century [4]; and the most recent 19th century pandemic, in which Y. pestis spread worldwide [5] and became endemic in several regions [6]. The discovery of molecular signatures of Y. pestis in prehistoric Eurasian individuals and two genomes from Southern Siberia suggest that Y. pestis caused some form of disease in humans prior to the first historically documented pandemic [7]. Here, we present six new European Y. pestis genomes spanning the Late Neolithic to the Bronze Age (LNBA; 4,800 to 3,700 calibrated years before present). This time period is characterized by major transformative cultural and social changes that led to cross-European networks of contact and exchange [8, 9]. We show that all known LNBA strains form a single putatively extinct clade in the Y. pestis phylogeny. Interpreting our data within the context of recent ancient human genomic evidence that suggests an increase in human mobility during the LNBA, we propose a possible scenario for the early spread of Y. pestis: the pathogen may have entered Europe from Central Eurasia following an expansion of people from the steppe, persisted within Europe until the mid-Bronze Age, and moved back toward Central Eurasia in parallel with human populations.","author":[{"family":"Andrades Valtueña","given":"Aida"},{"family":"Mittnik","given":"Alissa"},{"family":"Key","given":"Felix M."},{"family":"Haak","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Allmäe","given":"Raili"},{"family":"Belinskij","given":"Andrej"},{"family":"Daubaras","given":"Mantas"},{"family":"Feldman","given":"Michal"},{"family":"Jankauskas","given":"Rimantas"},{"family":"Janković","given":"Ivor"},{"family":"Massy","given":"Ken"},{"family":"Novak","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Pfrengle","given":"Saskia"},{"family":"Reinhold","given":"Sabine"},{"family":"Šlaus","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Spyrou","given":"Maria A."},{"family":"Szécsényi-Nagy","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Tõrv","given":"Mari"},{"family":"Hansen","given":"Svend"},{"family":"Bos","given":"Kirsten I."},{"family":"Stockhammer","given":"Philipp W."},{"family":"Herbig","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Krause","given":"Johannes"}],"citation-key":"andradesvaltuena2017StoneAgePlague","container-title":"Current Biology","container-title-short":"Curr.

  {"id":"baele2013AccurateModelSelection","abstract":"Recent implementations of path sampling (PS) and stepping-stone sampling (SS) have been shown to outperform the harmonic mean estimator (HME) and a posterior simulation-based analog of Akaike’s information criterion through Markov chain Monte Carlo (AICM), in Bayesian model selection of demographic and molecular clock models. Almost simultaneously, a Bayesian model averaging approach was developed that avoids conditioning on a single model but averages over a set of relaxed clock models. This approach returns estimates of the posterior probability of each clock model through which one can estimate the Bayes factor in favor of the maximum a posteriori (MAP) clock model; however, this Bayes factor estimate may suffer when the posterior probability of the MAP model approaches 1. Here, we compare these two recent developments with the HME, stabilized/smoothed HME (sHME), and AICM, using both synthetic and empirical data. Our comparison shows reassuringly that MAP identification and its Bayes factor provide similar performance to PS and SS and that these approaches considerably outperform HME, sHME, and AICM in selecting the correct underlying clock model. We also illustrate the importance of using proper priors on a large set of empirical data sets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Baele","given":"Guy"},{"family":"Li","given":"Wai Lok Sibon"},{"family":"Drummond","given":"Alexei J."},{"family":"Suchard","given":"Marc A."},{"family":"Lemey","given":"Philippe"}],"citation-key":"baele2013AccurateModelSelection","container-title":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Mol Biol Evol","DOI":"10.1093/molbev/mss243","ISSN":"0737-4038","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,2]]},"page":"239-243","PMCID":"PMC3548314","PMID":"23090976","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Accurate model selection of relaxed molecular clocks in Bayesian phylogenetics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3548314/","volume":"30"},

For Ottoman officials, these pandemics brought attention to the possible role of Qajar and British subjects in spreading cholera and plague, as well as the relationship between Iraq's ecology and recurring outbreaks. These developments paved the way for the expansion of Ottoman health institutions, such as quarantines, and the emergence of new conceptions of public health in the region. Specifically, quarantines proved instrumental not only to the delineation of the Ottoman–Qajar border, but also to defining an emerging Ottoman role in shaping Gulf affairs. Moreover, the Ottomans’ use of quarantines and simultaneous efforts to develop sanitary policies informed by local ecological realities signal a localized and ad hoc approach to disease prevention that has been overlooked. Ultimately, this study demonstrates that environmental factors operating on global and regional scales were just as important as geopolitical factors in shaping Ottoman rule in Iraq and the Gulf during the late Ottoman period.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Bolaños","given":"Isacar A."}],"citation-key":"bolanos2019OttomansGlobalCrises","container-title":"International Journal of Middle East Studies","DOI":"10.1017/S0020743819000667","ISSN":"0020-7438, 1471-6380","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,11]]},"language":"en","page":"603-620","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"The Ottomans during the global crises of cholera and plague: the View from Iraq and the Gulf.","title-short":"THE OTTOMANS DURING THE GLOBAL CRISES OF CHOLERA AND PLAGUE","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-middle-east-studies/article/ottomans-during-the-global-crises-of-cholera-and-plague-the-view-from-iraq-and-the-gulf/82A6A0E7CF8BD2138FA230AE4189057E","volume":"51"},

Despite their dominance in phylogenetic inference, it is evident that both are biologically unrealistic and that the real evolutionary process lies between these two extremes. Fortunately, intermediate models employing relaxed molecular clocks have been described. These models open the gate to a new field of “relaxed phylogenetics.” Here we introduce a new approach to performing relaxed phylogenetic analysis. We describe how it can be used to estimate phylogenies and divergence times in the face of uncertainty in evolutionary rates and calibration times. Our approach also provides a means for measuring the clocklikeness of datasets and comparing this measure between different genes and phylogenies. We find no significant rate autocorrelation among branches in three large datasets, suggesting that autocorrelated models are not necessarily suitable for these data. In addition, we place these datasets on the continuum of clocklikeness between a strict molecular clock and the alternative unrooted extreme. Finally, we present analyses of 102 bacterial, 106 yeast, 61 plant, 99 metazoan, and 500 primate alignments. From these we conclude that our method is phylogenetically more accurate and precise than the traditional unrooted model while adding the ability to infer a timescale to evolution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Drummond","given":"Alexei J."},{"family":"Ho","given":"Simon Y.

  {"id":"duchene2016GenomescaleRatesEvolutionary","abstract":"Estimating the rates at which bacterial genomes evolve is critical to understanding major evolutionary and ecological processes such as disease emergence, long-term host–pathogen associations and short-term transmission patterns. The surge in bacterial genomic data sets provides a new opportunity to estimate these rates and reveal the factors that shape bacterial evolutionary dynamics. For many organisms estimates of evolutionary rate display an inverse association with the time-scale over which the data are sampled. However, this relationship remains unexplored in bacteria due to the difficulty in estimating genome-wide evolutionary rates, which are impacted by the extent of temporal structure in the data and the prevalence of recombination. We collected 36 whole genome sequence data sets from 16 species of bacterial pathogens to systematically estimate and compare their evolutionary rates and assess the extent of temporal structure in the absence of recombination. The majority (28/36) of data sets possessed sufficient clock-like structure to robustly estimate evolutionary rates. However, in some species reliable estimates were not possible even with ‘ancient DNA’ data sampled over many centuries, suggesting that they evolve very slowly or that they display extensive rate variation among lineages. The robustly estimated evolutionary rates spanned several orders of magnitude, from approximately 10−5 to 10−8 nucleotide substitutions per site year−1. This variation was negatively associated with sampling time, with this relationship best described by an exponential decay curve. To avoid potential estimation biases, such time-dependency should be considered when inferring evolutionary time-scales in bacteria.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Duchêne","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Holt","given":"Kathryn E."},{"family":"Weill","given":"François-Xavier"},{"family":"Le Hello","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Hawkey","given":"Jane"},{"family":"Edwards","given":"David J."},{"family":"Fourment","given":"Mathieu"},{"family":"Holmes","given":"Edward C."}],"citation-key":"duchene2016GenomescaleRatesEvolutionary","container-title":"Microbial Genomics","container-title-short":"Microb Genom","DOI":"10.1099/mgen.0.000094","ISSN":"2057-5858","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,11,30]]},"PMCID":"PMC5320706","PMID":"28348834","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Genome-scale rates of evolutionary change in bacteria","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5320706/","volume":"2"},
  {"id":"duchene2020BayesianEvaluationTemporal","abstract":"Phylogenetic methods can use the sampling times of molecular sequence data to calibrate the molecular clock, enabling the estimation of evolutionary rates and timescales for rapidly evolving pathogens and data sets containing ancient DNA samples. A key aspect of such calibrations is whether a sufficient amount of molecular evolution has occurred over the sampling time window, that is, whether the data can be treated as having come from a measurably evolving population. Here, we investigate the performance of a fully Bayesian evaluation of temporal signal (BETS) in sequence data. The method involves comparing the fit to the data of two models: a model in which the data are accompanied by the actual (heterochronous) sampling times, and a model in which the samples are constrained to be contemporaneous (isochronous). We conducted simulations under a wide range of conditions to demonstrate that BETS accurately classifies data sets according to whether they contain temporal signal or not, even when there is substantial among-lineage rate variation. We explore the behavior of this classification in analyses of five empirical data sets: modern samples of A/H1N1 influenza virus, the bacterium Bordetella pertussis, coronaviruses from mammalian hosts, ancient DNA from Hepatitis B virus, and mitochondrial genomes of dog species. Our results indicate that BETS is an effective alternative to other tests of temporal signal. In particular, this method has the key advantage of allowing a coherent assessment of the entire model, including the molecular clock and tree prior which are essential aspects of Bayesian phylodynamic analyses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Duchene","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Lemey","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Stadler","given":"Tanja"},{"family":"Ho","given":"Simon Y W"},{"family":"Duchene","given":"David A"},{"family":"Dhanasekaran","given":"Vijaykrishna"},{"family":"Baele","given":"Guy"}],"citation-key":"duchene2020BayesianEvaluationTemporal","container-title":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1093/molbev/msaa163","ISSN":"0737-4038","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,1]]},"page":"3363-3379","source":"Silverchair","title":"Bayesian evaluation of temporal signal in measurably evolving populations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaa163","volume":"37"},
  {"id":"duchene2020TemporalSignalPhylodynamic","abstract":"The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak marks the first time that large amounts of genome sequence data have been generated and made publicly available in near real time. Early analyses of these data revealed low sequence variation, a finding that is consistent with a recently emerging outbreak, but which raises the question of whether such data are sufficiently informative for phylogenetic inferences of evolutionary rates and time scales. The phylodynamic threshold is a key concept that refers to the point in time at which sufficient molecular evolutionary change has accumulated in available genome samples to obtain robust phylodynamic estimates. For example, before the phylodynamic threshold is reached, genomic variation is so low that even large amounts of genome sequences may be insufficient to estimate the virus’s evolutionary rate and the time scale of an outbreak. We collected genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from public databases at eight different points in time and conducted a range of tests of temporal signal to determine if and when the phylodynamic threshold was reached, and the range of inferences that could be reliably drawn from these data. Our results indicate that by 2 February 2020, estimates of evolutionary rates and time scales had become possible. Analyses of subsequent data sets, that included between 47 and 122 genomes, converged at an evolutionary rate of about 1.1 × 10−3 subs/site/year and a time of origin of around late November 2019. Our study provides guidelines to assess the phylodynamic threshold and demonstrates that establishing this threshold constitutes a fundamental step for understanding the power and limitations of early data in outbreak genome surveillance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Duchene","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Featherstone","given":"Leo"},{"family":"Haritopoulou-Sinanidou","given":"Melina"},{"family":"Rambaut","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Lemey","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Baele","given":"Guy"}],"citation-key":"duchene2020TemporalSignalPhylodynamic","container-title":"Virus Evolution","container-title-short":"Virus Evolution","DOI":"10.1093/ve/veaa061","ISSN":"2057-1577","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,1]]},"source":"Silverchair","title":"Temporal signal and the phylodynamic threshold of SARS-CoV-2","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/veaa061","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"eroshenko2021EvolutionCirculationYersinia","abstract":"According to the whole genome SNP analysis of 38 Yersinia pestis strains isolated in the foci of the Northern Caspian and Northern Aral Sea regions in the 20th–early 21st centuries, between 1912 and 2015, the spatial and temporal structure of the 2.MED population of a medieval biovar in this region was determined. A phylogenetic branch 2.MED4 was identified which preceded the 2.MED1 branch that diverged later. 2.MED1 strains became the etiological agent of high-mortality plague outbreaks that occurred in the Northern Caspian region at the beginning of the 20th century. Later in the 20th century, the 2.MED1 branch became widespread in the Caspian Sea region, Caucasus, and vast areas of Central Asia. Based on the data of phylogenetic analysis, as well as epidemiological and epizootiological data, we reconstructed the paths of spread of the 2.MED1 branch in the Northern Caspian Sea region and in the Northern subzone of the Central Asian deserts. It is shown, that the reason for the activation of plague foci in the Northern Caspian region in the second half of the 20th century after a long inter-epizootic period caused by cyclical climate warming was the return of 2.MED1 from the foci of the Northern Aral Sea region. This led to the formation of stable plague foci in the Northern Caspian Sea region and Pre-Caucasus, which manifested epizootic activity in the second half of the 20th and early 21st centuries.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Eroshenko","given":"Galina A."},{"family":"Popov","given":"Nikolay V."},{"family":"Al’khova","given":"Zhanna V."},{"family":"Kukleva","given":"Lyubov M."},{"family":"Balykova","given":"Alina N."},{"family":"Chervyakova","given":"Nadezhda S."},{"family":"Naryshkina","given":"Ekaterina A."},{"family":"Kutyrev","given":"Vladimir V."}],"citation-key":"eroshenko2021EvolutionCirculationYersinia","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0244615","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,11]]},"language":"en","page":"e0244615","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Evolution and circulation of <i>Yersinia pestis</i> in the Northern Caspian and Northern Aral Sea regions in the 20th-21st centuries","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0244615","volume":"16"},

With the increasing genomic surveillance of pathogens, especially during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, new practical questions about their use are emerging. One such question focuses on the inclusion of un-sequenced case occurrence data alongside sequenced data to improve phylodynamic analyses. This approach can be particularly valuable if sequencing efforts vary over time. Using simulations, we demonstrate that birth–death phylodynamic models can employ occurrence data to eliminate bias in estimates of the basic reproductive number due to misspecification of the sampling process. In contrast, the coalescent exponential model is robust to such sampling biases, but in the absence of a sampling model it cannot exploit occurrence data. Subsequent analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the northwest USA supports these results. We conclude that occurrence data are a valuable source of information in combination with birth–death models. These data should be used to bolster phylodynamic analyses of infectious diseases and other rapidly spreading species in the future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Featherstone","given":"Leo A."},{"family":"Di Giallonardo","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Holmes","given":"Edward C."},{"family":"Vaughan","given":"Timothy G."},{"family":"Duchêne","given":"Sebastián"}],"citation-key":"featherstone2021InfectiousDiseasePhylodynamics","container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.13620","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/2041-210X.13620","page":"1498-1507","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Infectious disease phylodynamics with occurrence data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.13620","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"green2018PuttingAfricaBlack","abstract":"Did the Black Death, the famous, devastating plague pandemic that struck the Mediterranean and Western Europe in the mid-14th century and seeded new strains of the pathogen, Yersinia pestis, in new locales, also reach Sub-Saharan Africa? That it reached the Islamic North African littoral has never been in question: there is ample testimony from Arabic documentary sources for its devastating effects from Egypt to the Maghreb. But did it stop there? Archaeologists now have reason to believe that there was widespread abandonment of urban communities in West Africa in the 14th or 15th centuries. Focusing on the other side of the continent, the present essay argues that previously unutilized evidence—a “living archive” of genetic data combined with a new reading of linguistic and documentary evidence from the 14th through 20th centuries—suggests that plague did have a significant impact on pre-modern East Africa. The strains of Y. pestis currently found in East and Central Africa derive from one of the lineages involved in late medieval outbreaks in Central Eurasia. This post-Black Death strain, it is argued here, entered the continent most likely in the late 15th or early 16th century. This coincides with hitherto unexplained population migrations and other cultural signs of reactions to a deadly emerging disease. Although no aDNA (historical genetic material) for Y. pestis has yet been recovered from late medieval or early modern Africa, the present essay suggests that evidence for Y. pestis’s evolution and transcontinental movements, even those outside of Africa, can help archaeologists and historians draw Africa more centrally into the narratives of global history.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Green","given":"Monica H."}],"citation-key":"green2018PuttingAfricaBlack","container-title":"Afriques","DOI":"10.4000/afriques.2125","ISSN":"2108-6796","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","number":"09","publisher":"Institut des mondes africains (IMAF","source":"journals.openedition.org","title":"Putting Africa on the Black Death map: narratives from genetics and history","title-short":"Putting Africa on the Black Death map","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.4000/afriques.2125","volume":"9"},

Yet genetic approaches to plague’s history have established that Yersinia pestis, the causative organism of plague, suddenly diverged in Central Asia at some point before the Black Death, splitting into four new branches—a divergence geneticists have called the “Big Bang.” Drawing on a “biological archive” of genetic evidence, I trace the bacterial descendants of the Big Bang proliferation, comparing that data to historical human activities in and around the area of plague’s emergence. The Mongols, whose empire emerged in 1206, unwittingly moved plague through Central Eurasia in the thirteenth, not the fourteenth, century. Grain shipments that the Mongols brought with them to several sieges, including the siege of Baghdad, were the most likely mechanism of transmission. The fourteenth century plague outbreaks represent local spillover events out of the new plague reservoirs seeded by the military campaigns of the thirteenth century.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Green","given":"Monica H."}],"citation-key":"green2020FourBlackDeaths","container-title":"The American Historical Review","container-title-short":"The American Historical Review","DOI":"10.1093/ahr/rhaa511","ISSN":"0002-8762","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,29]]},"page":"1601-1631","source":"Silverchair","title":"The four Black Deaths","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ahr/rhaa511","volume":"125"},

A popular model in continuous phylogeography—with location data provided in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates—describes spread as a Brownian motion (Brownian Motion Phylogeography, BMP) in continuous space and time, akin to similar models of continuous trait evolution. Here, we show that reconstructions using this model can be strongly affected by sampling biases, such as the lack of sampling from certain areas. As an attempt to reduce the effects of sampling bias on BMP, we consider the addition of sequence-free samples from under-sampled areas. While this approach alleviates the effects of sampling bias, in most scenarios this will not be a viable option due to the need for prior knowledge of an outbreak’s spatial distribution. We therefore consider an alternative model, the spatial Λ-Fleming-Viot process (ΛFV), which has recently gained popularity in population genetics. Despite the ΛFV’s robustness to sampling biases, we find that the different assumptions of the ΛFV and BMP models result in different applicabilities, with the ΛFV being more appropriate for scenarios of endemic spread, and BMP being more appropriate for recent outbreaks or colonizations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Kalkauskas","given":"Antanas"},{"family":"Perron","given":"Umberto"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Yuxuan"},{"family":"Goldman","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Baele","given":"Guy"},{"family":"Guindon","given":"Stephane"},{"family":"Maio","given":"Nicola De"}],"citation-key":"kalkauskas2021SamplingBiasModel","container-title":"PLOS Computational Biology","container-title-short":"PLOS Computational Biology","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008561","ISSN":"1553-7358","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,6]]},"language":"en","page":"e1008561","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Sampling bias and model choice in continuous phylogeography: getting lost on a random walk","title-short":"Sampling bias and model choice in continuous phylogeography","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008561","volume":"17"},

Here we investigate the impact of low diversity sequence data on phylodynamic inference using the birth&ndash;death and coalescent exponential models. Through our simulation study, estimating the molecular evolutionary rate required enough sequence diversity and is an essential first step for any phylodynamic inference. Following this, the birth&ndash;death model outperforms the coalescent exponential model in estimating epidemiological parameters, when faced with low diversity sequence data due to explicitly exploiting the sampling times. In contrast, the coalescent model requires additional samples and therefore variability in sequence data before accurate estimates can be obtained. These findings were also supported through our empirical data analyses of an Australian and a New Zealand cluster outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2.

  {"id":"lemey2009BayesianPhylogeographyFinds","abstract":"As a key factor in endemic and epidemic dynamics, the geographical distribution of viruses has been frequently interpreted in the light of their genetic histories. Unfortunately, inference of historical dispersal or migration patterns of viruses has mainly been restricted to model-free heuristic approaches that provide little insight into the temporal setting of the spatial dynamics. The introduction of probabilistic models of evolution, however, offers unique opportunities to engage in this statistical endeavor. Here we introduce a Bayesian framework for inference, visualization and hypothesis testing of phylogeographic history. By implementing character mapping in a Bayesian software that samples time-scaled phylogenies, we enable the reconstruction of timed viral dispersal patterns while accommodating phylogenetic uncertainty. Standard Markov model inference is extended with a stochastic search variable selection procedure that identifies the parsimonious descriptions of the diffusion process. In addition, we propose priors that can incorporate geographical sampling distributions or characterize alternative hypotheses about the spatial dynamics. To visualize the spatial and temporal information, we summarize inferences using virtual globe software. We describe how Bayesian phylogeography compares with previous parsimony analysis in the investigation of the influenza A H5N1 origin and H5N1 epidemiological linkage among sampling localities. Analysis of rabies in West African dog populations reveals how virus diffusion may enable endemic maintenance through continuous epidemic cycles. From these analyses, we conclude that our phylogeographic framework will make an important asset in molecular epidemiology that can be easily generalized to infer biogeogeography from genetic data for many organisms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Lemey","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Rambaut","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Drummond","given":"Alexei J."},{"family":"Suchard","given":"Marc A."}],"citation-key":"lemey2009BayesianPhylogeographyFinds","container-title":"PLOS Computational Biology","container-title-short":"PLOS Computational Biology","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000520","ISSN":"1553-7358","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,9,25]]},"language":"en","page":"e1000520","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Bayesian phylogeography finds its roots","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000520","volume":"5"},
  {"id":"li2009GenotypingPhylogeneticAnalysis","abstract":"Background The species Yersinia pestis is commonly divided into three classical biovars, Antiqua, Medievalis, and Orientalis, belonging to subspecies pestis pathogenic for human and the (atypical) non-human pathogenic biovar Microtus (alias Pestoides) including several non-pestis subspecies. Recent progress in molecular typing methods enables large-scale investigations in the population structure of this species. It is now possible to test hypotheses about its evolution which were proposed decades ago. For instance the three classical biovars of different geographical distributions were suggested to originate from Central Asia. Most investigations so far have focused on the typical pestis subspecies representatives found outside of China, whereas the understanding of the emergence of this human pathogen requires the investigation of strains belonging to subspecies pestis from China and to the Microtus biovar. Methodology/Principal Findings Multi-locus VNTR analysis (MLVA) with 25 loci was performed on a collection of Y. pestis isolates originating from the majority of the known foci worldwide and including typical rhamnose-negative subspecies pestis as well as rhamnose-positive subspecies pestis and biovar Microtus. More than 500 isolates from China, the Former Soviet Union (FSU), Mongolia and a number of other foci around the world were characterized and resolved into 350 different genotypes. The data revealed very close relationships existing between some isolates from widely separated foci as well as very high diversity which can conversely be observed between nearby foci. Conclusions/Significance The results obtained are in full agreement with the view that the Y. pestis subsp. pestis pathogenic for humans emerged in the Central Asia region between China, Kazakhstan, Russia and Mongolia, only three clones of which spread out of Central Asia. The relationships among the strains in China, Central Asia and the rest of the world based on the MLVA25 assay provide an unprecedented view on the expansion and microevolution of Y. pestis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Yanjun"},{"family":"Cui","given":"Yujun"},{"family":"Hauck","given":"Yolande"},{"family":"Platonov","given":"Mikhail E."},{"family":"Dai","given":"Erhei"},{"family":"Song","given":"Yajun"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Zhaobiao"},{"family":"Pourcel","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Dentovskaya","given":"Svetlana V."},{"family":"Anisimov","given":"Andrey P."},{"family":"Yang","given":"Ruifu"},{"family":"Vergnaud","given":"Gilles"}],"citation-key":"li2009GenotypingPhylogeneticAnalysis","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0006000","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,6,22]]},"language":"en","page":"e6000","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Genotyping and phylogenetic analysis of <i>Yersinia pestis</i> by MLVA: insights into the worldwide expansion of Central Asia plague foci","title-short":"Genotyping and Phylogenetic Analysis of Yersinia pestis by MLVA","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0006000","volume":"4"},
  {"id":"little2007PlagueEndAntiquity","abstract":"Plague was a key factor in the waning of Antiquity and the beginning of the Middle Ages. Eight centuries before the Black Death, a pandemic of plague engulfed the lands surrounding the Mediterranean Sea and eventually extended as far east as Persia and as far north as the British Isles. Its persisted sporadically from 541 to 750, the same period that witnessed the distinctive shaping of the Byzantine Empire, a new prominence of the Roman papacy and of monasticism, the beginnings of Islam and the meteoric expansion of the Arabic Empire, the ascent of the Carolingian dynasty in Frankish Gaul and, not coincidentally, the beginnings of a positive work ethic in the Latin West. In this volume, the first on the subject, twelve scholars from a variety of disciplines-history, archaeology, epidemiology, and molecular biology- have produced a comprehensive account of the pandemic's origins, spread, and mortality, as well as its economic, social, political, and religious effects. The historians examine written sources in a range of languages, including Arabic, Syriac, Greek, Latin, and Old Irish. Archaeologists analyze burial pits, abandoned villages, and aborted building projects. The epidemiologists use the written sources to track the disease's means and speed of transmission, the mix of vulnerability and resistance it encountered, and the patterns of reappearence over time. Finally, molecular biologists, newcomers to this kind of investigation, have become pioneers of paleopathology, seeking ways to identity pathogens in human remains from the remote past.","author":[{"family":"Little","given":"Lester K."}],"citation-key":"little2007PlagueEndAntiquity","ISBN":"978-0-521-84639-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"313","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Plague and the End of Antiquity: The Pandemic of 541-750","title-short":"Plague and the End of Antiquity","type":"book","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511812934"},

Major pandemics and epidemics such as plague, cholera, flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have already afflicted humanity. The world is now facing the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Many infectious diseases leading to pandemics are caused by zoonotic pathogens that were transmitted to humans due to increased contacts with animals through breeding, hunting and global trade activities. The understanding of the mechanisms of transmission of pathogens to humans allowed the establishment of methods to prevent and control infections. During centuries, implementation of public health measures such as isolation, quarantine and border control helped to contain the spread of infectious diseases and maintain the structure of the society. In the absence of pharmaceutical interventions, these containment methods have still been used nowadays to control COVID-19 pandemic. Global surveillance programs of water-borne pathogens, vector-borne diseases and zoonotic spillovers at the animal-human interface are of prime importance to rapidly detect the emergence of infectious threats. Novel technologies for rapid diagnostic testing, contact tracing, drug repurposing, biomarkers of disease severity as well as new platforms for the development and production of vaccines are needed for an effective response in case of pandemics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Piret","given":"Jocelyne"},{"family":"Boivin","given":"Guy"}],"citation-key":"piret2021PandemicsThroughoutHistory","container-title":"Frontiers in Microbiology","container-title-short":"Front Microbiol","DOI":"10.3389/fmicb.2020.631736","ISSN":"1664-302X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,15]]},"page":"631736","PMCID":"PMC7874133","PMID":"33584597","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Pandemics throughout history","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7874133/pdf/fmicb-11-631736.pdf","volume":"11"},

There are 13 natural plague foci in the Caucasus, located on the territory of the Russian Federation, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia. We performed whole-genome sequencing of Y. pestis strains, isolated in the natural foci of the Caucasus and Transcaucasia. Using the data of whole-genome SNP analysis and Bayesian phylogeny methods, we carried out an evolutionary-phylogeographic analysis of modern population of the plague pathogen in order to determine the phylogenetic relationships of Y. pestis strains from the Caucasus with the strains from other countries.\nResults\nWe used 345 Y. pestis genomes to construct a global evolutionary phylogenetic reconstruction of species based on whole-genome SNP analysis. The genomes of 16 isolates were sequenced in this study, the remaining 329 genomes were obtained from the GenBank database. Analysis of the core genome revealed 3315 SNPs that allow differentiation of strains. The evolutionary phylogeographic analysis showed that the studied Y. pestis strains belong to the genetic lineages 0.PE2, 2.MED0, and 2.MED1. It was shown that the Y. pestis strains isolated on the territory of the East Caucasian high-mountain, the Transcaucasian high-mountain and the Priaraksinsky low-mountain plague foci belong to the most ancient of all existing genetic lineages - 0.PE2.\nConclusions\nOn the basis of the whole-genome SNP analysis of 345 Y. pestis strains, we describe the modern population structure of the plague pathogen and specify the place of the strains isolated in the natural foci of the Caucasus and Transcaucasia in the structure of the global population of Y. pestis.

Unlike the Black Death, its immediate predecessor, which seems to have originated in Central Asia, the pestis secunda emerged in Central Germany, most likely in the Frankfurt region, in summer 1356. Having seeded its new reservoir, the plague radiated from Central Germany, a landlocked region, into other parts of West Eurasia and North Africa, via inland routes. The inland mode of transmission is at odds with the geographic spread of the Black Death, whereby the plague arrived in West Eurasian and North African ports via maritime trade routes. To appreciate the appearance of the Central Germany plague reservoir in the early 1350s, the wider ecological, climatic and socio-economic context of the Frankfurt region is scrutinized, on the basis of textual, palaeoclimatic and palaeogenetic evidence. Although beyond the remit of this article, it argues that the Central German reservoir may have become the origin of recurrent late-medieval and early-modern plague outbreaks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Slavin","given":"Philip"}],"citation-key":"slavin2021OutWestFormation","container-title":"Past & Present","container-title-short":"Past & Present","DOI":"10.1093/pastj/gtaa028","ISSN":"0031-2746","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"page":"3-51","source":"Silverchair","title":"Out of the West: formation of a permanent plague reservoir in south-central Germany (1349–1356) and its implications","title-short":"Out of the West","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/pastj/gtaa028","volume":"252"},

Although the earliest evidence of Y. pestis infections in humans has been identified in Late Neolithic/Bronze Age Eurasia (LNBA 5000–3500y BP), these strains lack key genetic components required for flea adaptation, thus making their mode of transmission and disease presentation in humans unclear. Here, we reconstruct ancient Y. pestis genomes from individuals associated with the Late Bronze Age period (~3800 BP) in the Samara region of modern-day Russia. We show clear distinctions between our new strains and the LNBA lineage, and suggest that the full ability for flea-mediated transmission causing bubonic plague evolved more than 1000 years earlier than previously suggested.

Our data support an initial entry of the bacterium through eastern Europe, the absence of genetic diversity during the Black Death, and low within-outbreak diversity thereafter. Analysis of post-Black Death genomes shows the diversification of a Y. pestis lineage into multiple genetically distinct clades that may have given rise to more than one disease reservoir in, or close to, Europe. In addition, we show the loss of a genomic region that includes virulence-related genes in strains associated with late stages of the pandemic.

By using an extensive dataset consisting of date and location of cases for the third plague pandemic from 1772 to 1964 in China and a novel method (nearest neighbour approach) which deals with both short- and long-distance transmissions, we found the presence of major roads, rivers and coastline accelerated the spread of plague and shaped the transmission patterns. We found that plague spread velocity was positively associated with wet conditions (measured by an index of drought and flood events) in China, probably due to flood-driven transmission by people or rodents. Our study provides new insights on transmission patterns and possible mechanisms behind variability in transmission speed, with implications for prevention and control measures.

Here, we resolve the hypothetical role of trade routes through statistical analysis on the geo-referenced major trade routes in the early modern period and the 6,656 geo-referenced plague outbreak records in AD1347–1760. Ordinary Least Square (OLS) estimation results show that major trade routes played a dominant role in spreading plague in pre-industrial Europe. Furthermore, the negative correlation between plague outbreaks and their distance from major trade ports indicates the absence of a permanent plague focus in the inland areas of Europe. Major trade routes decided the major plague outbreak hotspots, while navigable rivers determined the geographic pattern of sporadic plague cases. A case study in Germany indicates that plague penetrated further into Europe through the local trade route network. Based on our findings, we propose the mechanism of plague transmission in historical Europe, which is imperative in demonstrating how pandemics were spread in recent human history.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Yue","given":"Ricci P.

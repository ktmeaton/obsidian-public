	abstract = {As we move amidst the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we have witnessed tremendous distress, death, and turmoil of everyday life for more than one year now. However, they are not modern phenomena; deadly pandemics have happened throughout recorded history. Pandemics such as the plague, Spanish Flu, HIV, and Ebola caused deaths, destruction of political regimes, as well as financial and psychosocial burdens. However, they sometimes resulted in scientific discoveries. Understanding the mechanism of the emergence of these pandemics is crucial to control any spreading pandemic and prevent the emergence of a potential new one. Public health agencies need to work on improving the countries' pandemic preparedness to prevent any future pandemics. The review article aims to shed light on some of the deadliest pandemics throughout history, information of critical importance for clinicians and researchers.},

	abstract = {Within a century after the death of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), the Muslims not only conquered new lands, but also became scientific innovators with originality and productivity. They hit the source ball of knowledge over the fence to Europe.By the ninth century, Islamic medical practice had advanced from talisman and theology to hospitals with wards, doctors who had to pass tests, and the use of technical terminology. The then Baghdad General Hospital incorporated innovations which sound amazingly modern. The fountains cooled the air near the wards or those afflicted with fever; the insane were treated with gentleness; and at night the pain of the restless was soothed by soft music and storytelling. The prince and pauper received identical attention: the destitute upon discharge received five gold pieces to sustain them during convalescence. While Paris and London were places of mud streets and hovels, Baghdad, Cairo and Cardoba had hospitals open to both male and female patients; staffed by attendants of both sexes. These medical centers contained libraries, pharmacies, the system of interns, externs, and nurses. There were mobile clinics to reach the totally disabled, the disadvantaged and those in remote areas. There were regulations to maintain quality control on drugs. Pharmacists became licensed professionals and were pledged to follow the physician's prescriptions. Legal measures were taken to prevent doctors from owning or holding stock in a pharmacy. The extent to which Islamic medicine advanced in the fields of medical education, hospitals, bacteriology, medicine, anesthesia, surgery, pharmacy, ophthalmology, psychotherapy and psychosomatic diseases are presented briefly.},

	abstract = {The threat of unstoppable plagues, such as AIDS and Ebola, is always with us. In Europe, the most devastating plagues were those from the Black Death pandemic in the 1300s to the Great Plague of London in 1665. For the last 100 years, it has been accepted that Yersinia pestis, the infective agent of bubonic plague, was responsible for these epidemics. This book combines modern concepts of epidemiology and molecular biology with computer-modelling. Applying these to the analysis of historical epidemics, the authors show that they were not, in fact, outbreaks of bubonic plague. Biology of Plagues offers a completely new interdisciplinary interpretation of the plagues of Europe and establishes them within a geographical, historical and demographic framework. This fascinating detective work will be of interest to readers in the social and biological sciences, and lessons learnt will underline the implications of historical plagues for modern-day epidemiology.},

	abstract = {Without doubt infectious pathogens have been an important challenge for hominines throughout the evolutionary process. With the advent of major changes in the relationship between Homo sapiens and the environment that occurred in the Holocene, it is highly likely that the effect of pathogens became more serious. This is both because of an increased number of organisms pathogenic to humans and because of the increased exposure to infectious pathogens that inevitably came with animal domestication and greater population density associated with agriculture, sedentary human societies and urbanism. Exploring the significance of infection in past human societies is a challenging exercise in which multiple lines of evidence must be exploited. One of these is the evidence of infectious disease that is present in archaeological human skeletal populations. One of the limitations of this evidence is that most of the infectious diseases that cause severe morbidity and mortality are acute diseases and rarely affect the skeleton. Some of the more chronic infectious diseases can affect the skeleton, but most individuals with these diseases will not have skeletal involvement. Nevertheless, the presence of these diseases in archaeological human skeletal samples provides at least some evidence regarding the health of past populations. The quality of these data depends on the accuracy with which observations about the prevalence of infectious disease in skeletal samples are made. The objective of this chapter is to provide the reader with a brief summary of the most typical skeletal manifestations of the infectious pathogens that most often cause disease in human groups and which also can be identified in at least some cases in human skeletal remains.},

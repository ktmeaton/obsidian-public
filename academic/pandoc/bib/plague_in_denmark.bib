Schweizerbart'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung}}, issn = {0003-5548}, abstract = {A total of 3033 skeletons from 11 medieval Danish cemeteries and 99 skeletons from the North Scandinavian medieval site of Westerhus were examined for seven lesions indicative of leprosy. The seven lesions are: rounding to the edge of the nasal aperture, degeneration of spina nasalis anterior, degeneration of the alveolar process of the pre-maxilla, porosity or perforation of the palatine process of maxilla, sub-periostal exostoses on the fibula, general swelling of the shaft of the fibula, and degeneration of the 5 th metatarsal bone. The dichotomous scores of these lesions were used to estimate sensitivity and specificity of the lesion scores in relation to leprosy and to estimate sample point prevalence of leprosy at death among adults. In turn the estimates of sensitivity and specificity were used to calculate an individual comprehensive statistic, λ, indicating leprosy status. Among adults the λ statistic did not associate with age at death, but this cannot be taken as a sign of lack of selective mortality for leprosy but a combination of the opposing effects of long waiting time before developing leprosy related lesions and short survival with these lesions. In urban communities sufferers of leprosy were institutionalized when the leprosarium was established (in Odense around 1275); in rural communities this did not happen but the pattern of burial does indicate an internal segregation of sufferers. In the early Middle Ages (AD 1150-1350) the point prevalence at death among adults of leprosy was higher in rural (25-40 percent) than in urban (10-20 percent) communities, and villages close to town showed lower frequencies of leprosy than villages situated further away from these centers. Leprosy declined in the late Middle Ages, first in towns and cities, later in rural communities. In Odense and Malmö it appears that leprosy was effectively eliminated by 1350 whereas there were still sufferers of leprosy at Øm Kloster around 1550. Leprosy appears to have been less common in North Scandinavia than in South Scandinavia, and there are some indications that leprosy was much more common in the Sámi population than in the North population of North Scandinavia. It is suggested that the rapid and early decline of leprosy in the towns was caused by the breaking of chains of infection by institutionalizing the most affected sufferers from leprosy. In rural communities it is suggested that the later decline of leprosy was brought about by a natural vaccination with the active substance in the Calmette vaccine, Mycobacterium bovis.}, file = {C\:\\Users\\user5028384\\Zotero\\storage\\LHMNJQH9\\Boldsen - 2009 - Leprosy in Medieval Denmark — Osteological and epi.pdf} }

A key aspect of such calibrations is whether a sufficient amount of molecular evolution has occurred over the sampling time window, that is, whether the data can be treated as having come from a measurably evolving population. Here, we investigate the performance of a fully Bayesian evaluation of temporal signal (BETS) in sequence data. The method involves comparing the fit to the data of two models: a model in which the data are accompanied by the actual (heterochronous) sampling times, and a model in which the samples are constrained to be contemporaneous (isochronous). We conducted simulations under a wide range of conditions to demonstrate that BETS accurately classifies data sets according to whether they contain temporal signal or not, even when there is substantial among-lineage rate variation. We explore the behavior of this classification in analyses of five empirical data sets: modern samples of A/H1N1 influenza virus, the bacterium Bordetella pertussis, coronaviruses from mammalian hosts, ancient DNA from Hepatitis B virus, and mitochondrial genomes of dog species. Our results indicate that BETS is an effective alternative to other tests of temporal signal. In particular, this method has the key advantage of allowing a coherent assessment of the entire model, including the molecular clock and tree prior which are essential aspects of Bayesian phylodynamic analyses.}, file = {C\:\\Users\\user5028384\\Zotero\\storage\\YF5P2XUU\\Duchene et al. - 2020 - Bayesian Evaluation of Temporal Signal in Measurab.pdf;C\:\\Users\\user5028384\\Zotero\\storage\\8FW8VYDP\\5867920.html} }

With the increasing genomic surveillance of pathogens, especially during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, new practical questions about their use are emerging. One such question focuses on the inclusion of un-sequenced case occurrence data alongside sequenced data to improve phylodynamic analyses. This approach can be particularly valuable if sequencing efforts vary over time. Using simulations, we demonstrate that birth–death phylodynamic models can employ occurrence data to eliminate bias in estimates of the basic reproductive number due to misspecification of the sampling process. In contrast, the coalescent exponential model is robust to such sampling biases, but in the absence of a sampling model it cannot exploit occurrence data. Subsequent analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the northwest USA supports these results. We conclude that occurrence data are a valuable source of information in combination with birth–death models.

A popular model in continuous phylogeography—with location data provided in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates—describes spread as a Brownian motion (Brownian Motion Phylogeography, BMP) in continuous space and time, akin to similar models of continuous trait evolution. Here, we show that reconstructions using this model can be strongly affected by sampling biases, such as the lack of sampling from certain areas. As an attempt to reduce the effects of sampling bias on BMP, we consider the addition of sequence-free samples from under-sampled areas. While this approach alleviates the effects of sampling bias, in most scenarios this will not be a viable option due to the need for prior knowledge of an outbreak’s spatial distribution. We therefore consider an alternative model, the spatial Λ-Fleming-Viot process (ΛFV), which has recently gained popularity in population genetics. Despite the ΛFV’s robustness to sampling biases, we find that the different assumptions of the ΛFV and BMP models result in different applicabilities, with the ΛFV being more appropriate for scenarios of endemic spread, and BMP being more appropriate for recent outbreaks or colonizations.}, langid = {english}, keywords = {Brownian motion,Latitude,Longitude,Phylogenetic analysis,Phylogenetics,Phylogeography,West Nile virus,Yellow fever virus}, file = {C\:\\Users\\user5028384\\Zotero\\storage\\G43PQADT\\Kalkauskas et al. - 2021 - Sampling bias and model choice in continuous phylo.pdf;C\:\\Users\\user5028384\\Zotero\\storage\\LVFRE3QQ\\article.html} }

This pandemic is generally understood as the consequence of a singular introduction of Yersinia pestis, after which the disease established itself in European rodents over four centuries.

Unlike the Black Death, its immediate predecessor, which seems to have originated in Central Asia, the pestis secunda emerged in Central Germany, most likely in the Frankfurt region, in summer 1356. Having seeded its new reservoir, the plague radiated from Central Germany, a landlocked region, into other parts of West Eurasia and North Africa, via inland routes. The inland mode of transmission is at odds with the geographic spread of the Black Death, whereby the plague arrived in West Eurasian and North African ports via maritime trade routes. To appreciate the appearance of the Central Germany plague reservoir in the early 1350s, the wider ecological, climatic and socio-economic context of the Frankfurt region is scrutinized, on the basis of textual, palaeoclimatic and palaeogenetic evidence. Although beyond the remit of this article, it argues that the Central German reservoir may have become the origin of recurrent late-medieval and early-modern plague outbreaks.}, file = {C\:\\Users\\user5028384\\Zotero\\storage\\WAH53DE2\\Slavin - 2021 - Out of the West Formation of a Permanent Plague R.pdf;C\:\\Users\\user5028384\\Zotero\\storage\\VRULZ333\\6120066.html} }

Ordinary Least Square (OLS) estimation results show that major trade routes played a dominant role in spreading plague in pre-industrial Europe. Furthermore, the negative correlation between plague outbreaks and their distance from major trade ports indicates the absence of a permanent plague focus in the inland areas of Europe. Major trade routes decided the major plague outbreak hotspots, while navigable rivers determined the geographic pattern of sporadic plague cases. A case study in Germany indicates that plague penetrated further into Europe through the local trade route network.

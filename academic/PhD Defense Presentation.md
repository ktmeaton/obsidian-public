## Land Acknowledgement

<hr>

<grid  drag="80 30" drop="10 20" flow="col">
_I acknowledge the traditional land on which I reside, is in Treaty Six Territory. I would like to thank the diverse Indigenous Peoples whose ancestorsâ€™ footsteps have marked this territory for centuries, such as nÃªhiyaw, DenÃ©, Anishinaabe, Nakota Isga, and Niitsitapi peoples. I also acknowledge this as the MÃ©tisâ€™ homeland and the home of one of the largest communities of Inuit south of the 60th parallel._

note: I'd like to start out today with a land acknowledgement. While I live in Edmonton, Alberta...

- _nÃªhiyaw_ (NAY-hee-yow)
- DenÃ© (DEH-neyh) (short)
- Anishinaabe (AH-nish-in-ah-abay)
- Nakota Isga (Na-KOHHH-tah EE-ska)
- Niitsitapi (Nit-si-tuhp-ee)
- MÃ©tisâ€™ (May-tea)

To learn more about the history of where we live, there's two resources I really enjoy. One is native-land.ca, where you can see all the nations that are found within Canada. And also firstnations.org has published free cookbooks, and I've really enjoyed learning about dishes made with plants that are found in my backyard.

## 1. Collection

<hr>

### How do I access DNA collected by _<u>other</u>_ researchers?

<grid  drag="45 65" drop="1 30" flow="col" border="2px solid black">

### Background
- Researchers are required to make their data publicly available.
- National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).
</grid>

<grid  drag="45 65" drop="-1 30" flow="col" border="2px solid black">

### Problem

- NCBI has limited options for browsing large amounts of data.
- Information is split across multiple databases.
</grid>


note: 

- Avalanche of data, new plague genomes published weekly, 1000+.
- Manual tracking was impossible, too much time, too many errors my excel sheet.
- It'd be like if half of your book was in one library section.

--

## Solution

<hr>

- Wrote software to automate data collection and organization.
- Written in `python`, executed as a `command-line` program.
- Fetches XML records from NCBI, formats into a pretty table.

### Problem

</grid>

--

## Solution

<hr>

- Split up _Yersinia pestis_ by genetic population.
- Estimate a clock model independently for each population.

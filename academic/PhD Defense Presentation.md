## Land Acknowledgement

<hr>

<grid  drag="80 30" drop="10 20" flow="col">
_I acknowledge the traditional land on which I reside, is in Treaty Six Territory. I would like to thank the diverse Indigenous Peoples whose ancestorsâ€™ footsteps have marked this territory for centuries, such as nÃªhiyaw, DenÃ©, Anishinaabe, Nakota Isga, and Niitsitapi peoples. I also acknowledge this as the MÃ©tisâ€™ homeland and the home of one of the largest communities of Inuit south of the 60th parallel._

note: I'd like to start out today with a land acknowledgement. While I live in Edmonton, Alberta...

- _nÃªhiyaw_ (NAY-hee-yow)
- DenÃ© (DEH-neyh) (short)
- Anishinaabe (AH-nish-in-ah-abay)
- Nakota Isga (Na-KOHHH-tah EE-ska)
- Niitsitapi (Nit-si-tuhp-ee)
- MÃ©tisâ€™ (May-tea)

To learn more about the history of where we live, there's two resources I really enjoy. One is native-land.ca, where you can see all the nations that are found within Canada. And also firstnations.org has published free cookbooks, and I've really enjoyed learning about dishes made with plants that are found in my backyard.

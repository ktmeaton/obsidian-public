I learned something amazing today! You can run a basic [[HTTP Server]] with:

```python
python3 -m http.server
```

Local files will then be accessible at localhost:8000. This is super helpful for testing [[Javascript]] scripts with local files.

```yaml
page: http://localhost:8000/index_arcdiagram.html
data: http://localhost:8000/data_arcdiagram.json
```

## [[Plague Phylodynamics and Phylogeography]]

[[TreeTime]] is getting so close to converging! If it doesn't do it after 100 iterations, I'm going to implement a hard cutoff of ```n_resolved=0``` and ```n_diff<=1```?.
It actually found a 0/0 state! But I coded the break wrong so it kept iterating.

## [[Javascript]] [[D3]]

I'm experimenting with using javascript to create an arc diagram. My 3 reference examples are:

1. [Publishing Relationships](https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/arc.html)
2. [Les Mis - Hover](https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/arc.html)
3. [Les Mis - Order](http://bl.ocks.org/mayblue9/dcc49ef6e3888f37f755177c4a248f2c)

My [[Arc Diagram|arc diagram]] will have the following properties.

```yaml
node:
  - size
  - x: loc latitute
link:
  - size: number of times the transition occurred
  - y: directionality
order-button:
  - latitude
  - longitude
  - node-size
  - link-size
```

I need to be able to map country to continent. Using the geo json file from 
<https://geojson-maps.ash.ms/>. I've modified the metadata.py script and rules.

Let's try to color the arc by the origin node. Now I want to add the hover option.

## [[TreeTime]]

That annoying error with an array being empty when trying to multiply distributions is resurfacing. I think I've narrowed it down to [this line](https://github.com/neherlab/treetime/blob/master/treetime/clock_tree.py#L555) since it only occurs in the [[Marginal|marginal]] reconstruction.

1. Are there any messages to multiply?

- Geospatial models for the #spread of #plague during the #Bronze_Age.
- Movement of plague from #Central_Eurasia to Europe, with expansion of people from #steppe. Persisted in #Europe until mid-Bronze Age. Moved back to #Central_Eurasia along with moving human populations.
- 6 #ancient #European #Yersinia_pestis #genomes, 4800 - 3700 YBP.
- All form an extinct clade.
-  #MRCA date: 6078 years (95% HPD: 5036 - YBP), agrees with [Ramussen et al. 2015](2021-03-20-05).

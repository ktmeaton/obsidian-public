# 2021-04-03 Scratch

I'm reading the [[TimeTree]] paper and getting some ideas. 
1. I should read the log closely, and possibly change the verbosity level.
1. I could change the Max Iterations, and check that the analysis is converging. I wish I could plot that somehow.
1. Try the rerooting options, since the linear regression is vaguely promising.

# 2021-04-03 Scratch

I'm reading the [[TimeTree]] paper and getting some ideas. 
1. I should read the log closely, and possibly change the verbosity level.
1. I could change the Max Iterations, and check that the analysis is converging. I wish I could plot that somehow.
1. Try the rerooting options, since the linear regression is vaguely promising.
1. Try to add extra length to the root before exporting. Probably after the ```clock_model``` step. This would help with actually clicking on the root mode in [[Auspice]].
1. I want to be able to plot the marginal probability distribution for a node (given the tree, ancestral sequence assignment, evolutionary model).
1. Check polytomy resolution, it looked the big bang polytomy wasn't resolved?
1. I'd like to take detailed notes on this paper.

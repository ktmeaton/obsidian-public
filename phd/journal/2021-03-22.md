## Notes

I created a template for People and added the following:

- [[@Hendrik Poinar]]
- [[@Julia Gamble]]
- [[@Jesper Boldsen]]
- [[@Marie-Helene B Hardy]]

I created a template for Literature and added the following:

- [[Andrades Valtuena et al. 2017 Stone Age Plague]]
- [[Eroshenko et al. 2021 Evolution Circulation Yersinia]]
- [[Rasmussen et al. 2015 Early Divergent Strains]]
- [[Sagulenko et al. 2018 TreeTime Maximum-Likelihood Phylodynamic]]

I discovered you can embed the content of a [[Markdown]] file within another like:

![](Kalkauskas%20et%20al.%202021%20Sampling%20Bias%20Model.md)

# faria2018GenomicEpidemiologicalMonitoring

## Summary

- I came across this literature from the #Phylogeography  [[BEAST]] tutorial on [Continuous Diffusion](https://beast.community/workshop_continuous_diffusion_yfv).
>We caution that hypotheses of human-to-human transmission linkage should not be tested directly using phylogenetic data alone, owing to the large undersampling of [nonhuman primates] infections.

## Figures

> Reconstructed spatiotemporal diffusion of the YFV outbreak. Phylogeny branches are arranged in space according the locations of phylogeny nodes (circles). Locations of external nodes are known, whereas those of internal nodes are inferred.

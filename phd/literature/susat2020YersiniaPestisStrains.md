# susat2020YersiniaPestisStrains

## Summary

- Sequenced two #Ancient [[Yersinia pestis]]  genomes from Riga, #Latvia dated to the #17th-Century
- Fell within the diversity of post [[Black Death]] strains.
- The two Latvian isolates did not cluster together.
- DropÂ in coverage of the #pPCP1 #plasmid region containing the #pla gene, caused by the presence of two distinct #pPCP1 plasmids.
- Found the same pattern in the majority of post-[[Black Death]] strains, but not in the [[Black Death]] strains.

## Summary

- Sequenced 9 #Ancient  #Yersinia-pestis  #Genome(s) from the #17th-Century  #Second-Plague-Pandemic.
- CHE1 is the first #Second-Plague-Pandemic genome from the #Caucasus region (ie. Non-European).
- Documents the importance of a non- #Eurocentric approach to historical #Plague dynamics and proposes an #Geographic-Origin(s) of plague introductions outside of Europe.

## Notes

- Argues that the narrative of #Medieval #Plague is dominated by the #Black-Death epidemic (1346-1353)
- However, while its #Narrative is often dominated by the #Black-Death epidemic (1346 to 1353)
- Estimated to have killed 30 to 60% of the #Europe(an) population within a few years.
- Outbreaks of plague were common in #Europe until the early #19th-century while recurring several decades beyond that in other parts of the world:

  - [[alfani2017PlagueLethalEpidemics]]
 - The above references (except alfani2017) are used to support the claim that:
	>Strikingly, around the middle of the 17th century, a major shift in plague dynamics occurred, after which only a single continental-scale epidemic was documented in Western Europe during the early 1700s [#18th-century].

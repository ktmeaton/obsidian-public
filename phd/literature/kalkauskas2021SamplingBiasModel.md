# kalkauskas2021SamplingBiasModel

## Summary

- #Phylogeography  reconstructions using a #Brownian-Motion model are strongly affected by #Sampling-Bias(es), such as the lack of sampling from certain areas.
- Attempt to reduce the effects of sampling bias on BMP, we consider the addition of #Sequence-Free samples from #Under-Sample(d) areas.
- This approach works well, but is generally not a viable option due to the need for prior knowledge of an outbreak’s spatial distribution.
- The spatial Λ-Fleming-Viot process (ΛFV) is more appropriate for scenarios of endemic spread, and BMP is more appropriate for recent outbreaks or colonizations.

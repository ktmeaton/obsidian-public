## Summary

- Sequenced 9 #Ancient  [[Yersinia pestis]]  [[Genome]]s from the #17th-Century  #Second-Plague-Pandemic.
- CHE1 is the first #Second-Plague-Pandemic genome from the #Caucasus region (ie. Non-European).
- Documents the importance of a non- #Eurocentric approach to historical [[Plague]] dynamics and proposes an [[Geographic Origin]] of plague introductions outside of Europe.

## Notes

- Argues that the narrative of #Medieval [[Plague]] is dominated by the [[Black Death]] epidemic (1346-1353)
- However, while its #Narrative is often dominated by the [[Black Death]] epidemic (1346 to 1353)
- Estimated to have killed 30 to 60% of the [[Europe]](an) population within a few years.
- Outbreaks of plague were common in [[Europe]] until the early #19th-century while recurring several decades beyond that in other parts of the world:
  - [[eckert2000RetreatPlagueEurope]]
  - [[eckert1996StructurePlaguesPestilence]]
  - [[alfani2013PlagueSeventeethcenturyEurope]]
  - [[alfani2017PlagueLethalEpidemics]]
 - The above references (except alfani2017) are used to support the claim that:
	>Strikingly, around the middle of the 17th century, a major shift in plague dynamics occurred, after which only a single continental-scale epidemic was documented in Western Europe during the early 1700s [#18th-century].

- Some interesting background on the historical #Caucasus.
- >Considering that the disease did not advance far into France during the Great Plague of Marseille, it seems unlikely that the lineage introduced into Europe in 1720 was reintroduced from there to the Caucasus region and then reached Chechnya. Instead, we propose that the disease reached Chechnya directly on a separate route via land or that the region is located close to the wildlife reservoir that is responsible for the plague lineage documented in Europe following the Black Death.
 
- Known modern plague foci are situated in neighboring Georgia, where written sources describing cases of bubonic plague date from the 11th century CE until after the start of the Third Plague Pandemic (1894) ([[oconnel2010SurveillancePlagueNaturalFoci]]).

## Summary

>* <i>Yersinia pestis</i> was common across #Eurasia in the [[LNBA]].
>* The #MRCA  of all <i>Y. pestis</i> was 5,783 years ago
>* The #ymt gene was acquired before 951 cal BC, giving rise to #Transmission via #Flea(s).


- According to [[Spyrou et al. 2018 Analysis 3800-Year-Old Yersinia]]:
>  show genetic characteristics incompatible with arthropod adaptation
	ie. Not capable of causing bubonic plague.

## Summary
- The authors demonstrate how [[Sampling Bias|sampling bias]] is severely detrimental to [[Phylogeography|phylogeographic]] models of [[Pathogen|pathogen]] spread. They show that the inclusion of [[Sequence-Free]] samples significantly alleviates [[Sampling Bias]]. However, this approach depends on knowing the [[full extent of an organism's spatial distribution]].
- This is extremely exciting for two reasons:
	- Provides a statistical argument for the importance of [[Interdisciplinary]] work, and the dangers of not doing so (in agreement with [[Faria et al. 2018 Genomic Epidemiological Monitoring|Faria et al. 2018]]). Thus supplying a strong motivation to purse this work.
	- Provides an explicit methodological framework for the integration of [[Interdisciplinary|interdisciplinary]] datasets, in the form of [[Sequence-Free]] data being added to [[Genome|genomic]] analyses.
- The [[Sequence-Free]] approach is cited to [[Edwards et al. 2011]] and [[Duchene et al. 2019]]. An important question is how many [[Sequence-Free|sequence-free]] samples do you need? They tested 100 sequence samples, and 20 sequence-free was sufficient (as compared to 40, 60, or 80)
- [[Phylogeography]] reconstructions using a [[Brownian-Motion]] model are strongly affected by [[Sampling Bias]], such as [[Under-represented|undersampling]] of certain areas.
- The spatial [[Î›-Fleming-Viot]] process (Î›FV) is more appropriate for scenarios of [[Endemic]] [[Spread]], and BMP is more appropriate for recent outbreaks or colonizations.
- The authors have helpful advice regarding whether to choose [[discrete trait|discrete]] analysis or [[continuous trait|continuous analysis]]. [[discrete trait|Discrete]] is either out of necessity (only country is known) and/or spread is hindered by geographical or political barriers. [[continuous trait|Continuous]] is appropriate when [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] are known, and [[Spread|spread]] is geographically homogenous over an area (ie. continent.)

## Notes

- I'm not certain that how many [[Sequence-Free]] samples to include is entirely numerical.

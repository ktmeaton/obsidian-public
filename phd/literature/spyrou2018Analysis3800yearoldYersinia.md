## Summary

- Sequenced the new strain RT5 from the Late Bronze Age period (~3800 BP) in the Samara region of modern-day Russia.
- This strain is distinct from the #LNBA strains of [[rasmussen2015EarlyDivergentStrains]] both in clade placement and the acquisition of components required for  flea-mediated transmission #ymt ?

>- Propose that several Y. pestis lineages were established during the Bronze Age, some of which persist to the present day.

- The #Virulence profile of RISE509 is identical to that of isolates RK1.001, GEN72, Gyvakarai1, and Kunila23.
- The #Virulence profile of 1343UnTal85 is identical to 6Postillionstrasse and RISE5053.
- The #Clade/LNBA,  #Clade/0-PE/2 and #Clade/0-PE/4 strains seem to lack certain virulence determinants
- RT5 harbours all known #virulence factors with the exception of the #Filamentous-Prophage (YpfÎ¦), which is, however, most consistently identified among #Clade/1-ORI strains.

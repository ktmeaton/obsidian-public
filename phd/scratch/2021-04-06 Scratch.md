Will [[TreeTime]] ever stop before the ```max_iter```? Let's find out:

```python
while niter < max\_iter:
	self.logger("###TreeTime.run: ITERATION %d out of %d iterations"%(niter+1,max\_iter),0)
	...
	if ndiff==0 and n_resolved==0 and Tc!='skyline':
		self.logger("###TreeTime.run: CONVERGED",0)
		break
```

I will log the parameters that can start a break:

```
ndiff==0 and n_resolved==0 and Tc!='skyline':
self.logger("###TEST: ndiff={}, n_resoved={}, Tc={}".format(ndiff, n_resolved, Tc))
```

```n_resolved``` refers to polytomies, let's investigate that.

- #⬜/✨ | [[2021-04-06]] | Change log verbosity back to level 4 for polytomies.
- #⬜/✨ | [[2021-04-06]] | Log the gtr model to output.

The [[Polytomy|polytomies]] are slow to resolved but have steady progress, it probably needs at least 10 iterations to get there. The [[ancestral sequence reconstruction]] is more unstable, I'm curious if that will start to improve once all the [[Polytomy|polytomies]] are resolved?
```
n_resolved: 64, 40, 14, 4, 3,  5,  0,  0,  1
n_diff: 	27, 24, 82, 8, 29, 24, 27, 56, 53
```
All polytomies were resolved by iteration 7, will it stay that way? No...
A 'good' test might be to run it for 100 iterations and see if it ever converges.

### [[GTR]] [[Substitution Rate|Substitution Model]]
Let's see how the gtr matrix changes with different models. How do you specify gtr parameters?

1. Target Model to match:
	```yaml
	rates-parameters:
	  - A-C: 1.0000
	  - A-G: 1.2368
	  - A-T: 0.3638
	  - C-G: 0.3638
	  - C-T: 1.2368
	  - G-T: 1.0000
	state-frequencies:
	  - pi(A): 0.2626
	  - pi(C): 0.2365
	  - pi(G): 0.2391
	  - pi(T): 0.2619
	```
  - In IQTREE, A-C was the normalizing transition.
  
1. Specify the alphabet in treetime instantiation:
	```python
	alphabet="nuc_nogap"
	```

1.  Specify the frequencies in the run function:
	```python
    infer_gtr=True,
    fixed_pi=fixed_pi,	
	```
	
```text
Substitution rate (mu): 1.0

Equilibrium frequencies (pi_i):
  A: 0.2627
  C: 0.2364
  G: 0.239
  T: 0.2619

Symmetrized rates from j->i (W_ij):
	A		C		G		T
  A	0		1.4419	1.8599	0.8308
  C	1.4419	0		0.3794	1.8766
  G	1.8599	0.3794	0		1.5799
  T	0.8308	1.8766	1.5799	0
  
Actual rates from j->i (Q_ij):
	A		C		G		T
  A	0		0.3788	0.4886	0.2183
  C	0.3408	0		0.0897	0.4436
  G	0.4445	0.0907	0		0.3776
  T	0.2176	0.4915	0.4138	0
  
IQTREE Compare (Divide everything by 1.4419)
  - A-C: 1.0000
  - A-G: 1.2368 (1.28989)
  - A-T: 0.3638 (0.576)
  - C-G: 0.3638 (0.2631)
  - C-T: 1.2368 (1.3014)
  - G-T: 1.0000 (1.0957)  
```

```yaml
ndiff:		3,  4,  2,  0, 5, 4, 2, 37, 0, 4,
nresolved:	74, 15, 14, 7, 4, 3, 0, 1,  2, 0,
```

That made a dramatic difference in the ancestral reconstruction (ndiff).

I'm getting an error during the final stage with marginal likelihood and skyline.

```text
ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity
```

I'm going to upgrade to v0.8.1 since that release fixes this. Nope, I'm still getting that error. I misinterpreted the discussion in the [associated issue](https://github.com/neherlab/treetime/issues/130).

I'm going to rerun the previous parameters that worked. The only two parameters I've changed are regarding the substitution model, ```fixed_pi``` and ```alphabet```. But this problem started yesterday when I hadn't even introduced ```alphabet``` yet. So let's introduce ```alphabet``` next. Success! Good news is the rate matrix is fixed, bad news is the frequencies are still wrong. So I suspect it's ```fixed_pi``` that is causing the issue?

```yaml
Substitution rate (mu): 1.0

Equilibrium frequencies (pi_i):
  A: 0.1885
  C: 0.3123
  G: 0.297
  T: 0.2022

Symmetrized rates from j->i (W_ij):
	A		C		G		T
  A	0		1.5599	2.0566	1.12
  C	1.5599	0		0.2962	1.9409
  G	2.0566	0.2962	0		1.6708
  T	1.12	1.9409	1.6708	0

Actual rates from j->i (Q_ij):
	A	C	G	T
  A	0	0.294	0.3876	0.2111
  C	0.4872	0	0.0925	0.6062
  G	0.6109	0.088	0	0.4963
  T	0.2264	0.3924	0.3378	0
  
IQTREE Compare (Divide everything by 1.5599)
  - A-C: 1.0000
  - A-G: 1.2368 (1.3184)
  - A-T: 0.3638 (0.7179)
  - C-G: 0.3638 (0.1898)
  - C-T: 1.2368 
  - G-T: 1.0000   
```

Note: gaps are [used in ancestral state reconstruction, but are ignored for branch length calculations](https://github.com/neherlab/treetime/issues/139).

- #⬜/✨ | [[2021-04-06]] | Wrote the filtered alignment from clock_model.

Everytime I run the function ```branch_length_to_years```, it resets the root length. Should I manually adjust it after every function call? The more I change things, the worse it gets. I might just try the approach of doing a midpoint reroot after IQTREE in FigTree. A number of [[TreeTime]] functions change the root branch length to 0.1, I'll just leave that untouched.

The last parameter test for today will be to add back in ```fixed_pi```.  Confirmed, ```fixed_pi``` is what breaks it. Then I will run this overnight for 100 iterations to see if it ever converges.

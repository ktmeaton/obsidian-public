I'm interested in the [[PhyD3]] tool and possible hosting it myself. Document is here: <https://phyd3.bits.vib.be/documentation.html>. To get good customization, I'd probably need to convert trees to PhyloXML.

Focusing questions from [[@Hendrik Poinar]]:

1. With the data you’ve compiled into this great database what are the directions it can take in ms form?  
	- Descriptive - that is describe in detail the database what it does, how it operates, what it can and should be used for.  
	- Test of a certain hypothesis - i.e. Does the structure allow for directionality of contagion to be mapped - what are the inherent biases in the data or how does the rate across the tree make it impossible to date important events in the ‘life-history’ of this bug (i.e. polytomy).  
  	- Yp update. Does the data suffice to simply draw attention to a particular feature of the relationships of these new strains that makes for an importnat and interesting update to Yp phylogeny or say virulence (pla +/-)?

## Meeting with [[@Hendrik Poinar|Hendrik]]

### Objectives
1. Characterize the genomic dataset (collection and curation).
2. Describe the (big-picture) variance associated with [[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]] dating and geographic estimates.
3. Demonstrate the *analytical and interpretive* risks associated with sampling bias:
		A. Sparsely sampled clade (ex. Second Pandemic?) vs.
		B. Densely sampled clade (ex. Caucasus?) 
		- Knockout a region, visualize how temporal/geographic estimates change.
		- Add case records from an un-sampled region, visualize how results change.

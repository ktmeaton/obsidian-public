I'm still interested in preparing a [[BEAST|BEAST]] run where my [[Timetree]] from [[TreeTime]] is the starting tree.

## Jupyter Notebooks over ssh

Troubleshooting between computers is very hard since I encoded the [[dill]] objects (which are not version controlled). At the very least, I think I need to save the [[Clock Model|clock model]]/[[Regression|regression]] model to a file.

I really need the information encoded in the objects themselves, especially because I've split modelling and plotting into two notebooks. Let's revisit the idea of running a [[Jupyter Notebook]] server over[[ssh]]. I successfully made this work in the [[X11 Server]] note.

## Rate Variation

First off, let's examine the rate variation distribution plots. I remember that I played with the bin sizes previously when I was expecting it to be a [[Lognormal|lognormal]] [[Distribution|distribution]]. The rate does appear to be [[Multimodal|multimodal]]. It's roughly [[Lognormal|lognormal]], but with multiple peaks in the lower range. But what's going on with the y axis? Why are the units so high? I wonder if this is because of the [[Kernel Density]] estimate and that I switched from [[seaborn|seaborn's]] [[histplot]] to [[distplot]]. I confirmed that [[distplot]] was indeed the problem, so I switched back to [[histplot]].

Also, the [[Timetree]] didn't plot correctly in ```clock_plot``` but it did in ```mugration_plot``` so let's follow up there. My 'hack' to catch bad ranges is missing nodes where both upper and and lower are bad. I've implemented the fix in both ```clock_model``` and ```clock_plot```. I commented on a [relevant issues](https://github.com/neherlab/treetime/issues/134) about this problem.

I added the axis with the clade colors. I noticed something bizarre in that [[SVG]] export had random node bars placed around 0 years. Whereas the [[JPG]] export did not, and matched the preview in the [[Jupyter Notebook]].

## [[GitHub]]
I should release a new version of [[plague-phylogeography]], as a checkpoint before [[BEAST]] work intensifies.

## Emails

>"...it appears that the VPR’s message that we’ve moved back into Phase 1 does mean that graduate students must press pause on working in labs for now."

## [[Obsidian]]

I wonder if I can copy an obsidian template (ie. the .obsidian) folder into a new vault to keep my settings? I'll start by making a new vault:

```bash
mkdir life/
cp -r phd/.obsidian life/
```

If I wanted to get real crazy, it could be a git [[submodule]]... Let's give it a try.
1. Rename my [[GitHub]] repository to [obsidian-vaults](https://github.com/ktmeaton/obsidian-vaults)
1. Create a new [[Github]] repository called [obsidian-settings]().

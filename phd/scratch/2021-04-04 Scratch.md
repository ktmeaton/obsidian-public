## Marginal Distribution

>1. I want to be able to plot the marginal probability distribution for a node (given the tree, ancestral sequence assignment, evolutionary model).

I think clues will be in the function [```get_max_posterior_region```](https://github.com/neherlab/treetime/blob/f53f678a487ac5efa803bb39386b62260f1195f2/treetime/clock_tree.py#L831). Each node has an attribute ```marginal_pos_LH```, let's investigate that. Great success!

## Figures

When I say broad view on temporal signal, what do I mean?
1. Compare known vs. joint vs. marginal:
    - Tips by clade (Violin or Box?)
2. Variation at nodes of historical interest:
    - Root
    - Pandemics
    - Big Bang
 
How best to represent the variation associated with geography? I could draw a map, and shade all the provinces that are included in the model? And then have a heatmap to show the different states.

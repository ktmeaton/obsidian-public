## Marginal Distribution

>1. I want to be able to plot the marginal probability distribution for a node (given the tree, ancestral sequence assignment, evolutionary model).

I think clues will be in the function [```get_max_posterior_region```](https://github.com/neherlab/treetime/blob/f53f678a487ac5efa803bb39386b62260f1195f2/treetime/clock_tree.py#L831). Each node has an attribute ```marginal_pos_LH```, let's investigate that. Great success!

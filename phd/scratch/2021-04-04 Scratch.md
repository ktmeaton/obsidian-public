## Marginal Distribution

>1. I want to be able to plot the marginal probability distribution for a node (given the tree, ancestral sequence assignment, evolutionary model).

I think clues will be in the function [```get_max_posterior_region```](https://github.com/neherlab/treetime/blob/f53f678a487ac5efa803bb39386b62260f1195f2/treetime/clock_tree.py#L831). Each node has an attribute ```marginal_pos_LH```, let's investigate that. Great success!

## Figures

When I say broad view on temporal signal, what do I mean?
1. Variation of known vs. estimated:
   - Tips by clade.
2. Variation at nodes of historical interest:
  - Root
  - Pandemics
  - Big Bang

## Summary

Today I learned the following things:
- The [[skyline]] parameter to [[Treetime]] is causing problems, not [[Marginal|marginal]].
- [[BEAST|BEAST]] fails to start when a parameter/prior is set wrong. In [[plague-phylogeography]], trying to run the whole tree required dropping the rate down to near-zero. I suspect this is because there is such a large number of near-zero length branches.
- Taking subtrees like [[0.PE2]] and [[2.MED]] appears to run fine.
- I'll want to run the subclades for at least 10M-50M generations. 13m29s/Msamples, 2-10 hours.

## [[TreeTime]]
- #⬜/✨ | [[2021-04-12]] | TreeTime tracelog PR

> This PR adds the tracelog feature proposed in Issue #148. It includes the following changes:
> - Adds a function ```tracelog_run``` to the ```TreeTime``` class. This function parses and stores a selection of parameters that change for each iteration of the ```run``` function.
> - Adds an attribute ```trace_run``` to the ```TreeTime``` class. This is a dictionary where keys are the iterations, and values are the parameters associated with each iteration.
>
> The ```tracelog_run``` takes a filename as an argument. By default I set this to "trace_run.log". I wasn't sure how to integrate this into the argument parser and pass it through.
>
> Feel free to let me know if this useful and/or if any additional changes should be made :)


I need to squash all the changes into a single commit for the PR.
```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3 
```

### Rerooting

If I start out with a nicely rooted tree, both the original tree and the output timetree end up with a multifurcation at the root.

| divtree (pre)                        | divtree (post)                       |   timetree                                   | 
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| ![[Root Length 1.png]] | ![[Root Length 2.png]] | ![[Root Length 3.png]] |

What if I change the ```root``` parameter to None?  Perfect :)

| ![[Root Length 4.png]] | ![[Root Length 5.png]] | ![[Root Length 7.png]] |

### Errors

Is it ```time_marginal``` or ```Tc='skyline'``` that is causing error in the final optimization? I'm almost certain that [[Tree Prior|skyline]] is the problem.

## [[BEAST]]

This is probably an excellent test for BEAST since it has a multifurcation in it.

- [x] Strip the comments from the nexus.

So on first run, BEAST exits with an error as expected. 

- [x] Remove multifurcations.
- [x] Change 0 length branches.

BEAST ran when I set the min branch length to the root as minimum. Now let's try with the full dataset. The whole tree does not run, but certain sub branches do. What is causing the problem? Build increasingly bigger subtrees.

Which clades work and which fail?

It's looking like a large number of short branches are a problem.

WHOA WHOA WHOA. I checked the 'normalize' button  and set discrete rates to 1 in the clock model and it started working. What does that do? The starting likelihood is exceptionally low:

```text
Start likelihood: -2.1000000000000006E101
```

Also the seed does seem to matter:
```yaml
cmd: beast -seed 123 beast_break.xml
result: Success
cmd: beast beast_break.xml
result: Fail
```
No, that's not correct. If I keep rerunning over and over again, eventually it will start...

```bash
attempt="0"
while [[ $attempt -lt 100 ]]
do
  echo "Attempt:" $attempt;
  beast -overwrite beast.xml
  attempt=$[$attempt+1];
done
```

>nonZeroRatePrior.s:location-prior is zero (so the log of it is -Infinity). This usually happens when there are many states for the discrete trait model. The prior on the number of rates that is non-zero is rather tight, and initially all rates are non-zero, so there are n(n-1)/2 non-zero rates (for n discrete states), which can result in the probability of that many rates become zero due to numeric issues. **To fix this, increase the mean of the prior so the analysis starts**. If you really want to keep the prior as is, you can start with a more relaxed, run the chain for a little while till many rates become zero (which usually happens quite quickly), then stop the chain, change the prior back and resume.

> If the log likelihood of the tree is -Inf, his may be because the initial, random tree is so large that it has an extremely bad likelihood which is being rounded to zero.

I think the summary is that my starting tree is just too low of likelihood to run...

Changing the following parameters did improve ```beast_break.xml```:

```yaml
clock-rate: 1.0E-20 
ucldStdev:
  - alpha: 100  
```

WHOA. Setting Clock.rate to 1.0E-100 got it to start!!!! The limit on the clock.rate is around 1E-300

```bash
treeannotator -burnin 1 -hpd2D 0.95 beast.trees beast_mcc-hpd95.nex
```

![[spreaD3 Testing 1.png]]

Let's go back to to the [[phylogeography transform]] tutorial with IE.tree. The units on this tree are very small, ranging from 0-4, and max tree length is 9

```yaml
clock:
  - model: relaxed-clock-log-normal
  - number-of-discrete-rates: -1
  - rate: 1.0
```

I just ran the [[0.PE2]] [[Clade|clade]], and the parameters were very comparable The rate seems to be about 2E-4, and the StDev around 5.

I'm curious now if it polytomies and 0 branches are ok. I think.... it's working?

>[ucld.stdev This is the [[standard deviation]] (σ) of the [[uncorrelated log-normal relaxed clock]] (in log-space). If this parameter is 0 there is no variation in rates among branches. If this parameter is greater than 1 then the standard deviation in branch rates (in real space) is greater than the mean rate.](https://www.beast2.org/parameters/)

>[the [[coefficient of rate variation]] in the [[UCLD]] model. This parameter is the [[standard deviation]] of the branch rates divided by the mean rate (Drummond et al., 2006). If the lower 95% limit of the [[posterior density]] is close to zero, the data can be considered to have evolved in a clock-like manner. In such cases we report the rate estimates from the SC model, otherwise we report those from the UCLD model. Importantly, this method for clock model selection has similar performance to more computationally intensive methods (Ho et al., 2015). To determine the impact of the choice of clock model in the estimates from BEAST we also compared the SC and UCLD estimates with those obtained from the UCED model](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/32/22/3375/2525597)

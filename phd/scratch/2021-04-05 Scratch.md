Today I'm going to work on cleaning up scratch space on:

## [[plague-phylogeography]]

How good is [[Tip Dating|tip dating]]? I want to compare the known dates of tips (by clade) to the estimated dates. The joint likelihood dates are constraints so they won't differ. But the marginal estimate and ranges will. However, many of the known dates are ranges. Which poses a problem for the boxplot. Maybe I'll just start by taking the mean. This may also help [[Sebastian Duchene]] and [[@Leo Featherstone]] in wanting to constraint the uncertainty.

Good news is that known date is tightly linked to both the joint and marginal date of tips. 


|  Modern (Known vs. Marginal)   |     Ancient(Known vs. Marginal)      |

I'd like to plot something similar involving the marginal distributions like I did in [[2021-04-04 Scratch]]. But maybe I can have vertical violin plots instead.

### Model Summary

What statistics and figures summarize the clock model?
 - Clock Type: RTT (No Internal Nodes)
 - Clock Parameters: Rate Variation Histogram
 - Tree Prior: Bayesian Skyline

|        Root-To-Tip Regression on Date        |
|:--------------------------------------------:|

|       Relaxed Clock Rate Variation          |
|:---------------------------------------:|
| ![[Rate Variation Across Branches.png]] |


|          Tree Prior         |
|:---------------------------------------:|
| ![[Maximum Likelihood Skyline.png]] |

How can I change the number of groups or parameters in the [[Tree Prior|skyline]]? The command-line usage of [[TreeTime]] has this parameter:

```yaml
'--n-skyline' : number of grid points in skyline coalescent model (Default: 20)
```

Which relates to the ```run``` function's keyword ```n_points=```. The default is 20, I'm going to double that to 40.

I should remove clock_plot from the test workflow since it assumes relaxed clock.

## Clock Model Stability

I'm going to rerun ```clock_model``` and ```clock_plot``` to try to get node dating stability.

## Root

>1. Try the rerooting options, since the linear regression is vaguely promising.

Methods ```min_dev``` and ```least_squares``` both wanted to root within the 0.PE clade

I'm going to experiment with adding a pseudo branch length to the root.

- #â¬œ/ðŸš‚ | [[2021-04-05]] | Try to add mutations to tree df.

I didn't know you could pass ```branch_labels``` as a parameter of ```Phylo.draw```!
```python
    # plot the tree and label branches by mutation
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(18,13))
    ax.set_title("branches annotated by inferred mutations", fontsize=18)
    ax.set_axis_off()
    Phylo.draw(myTree.tree, label_func = lambda x:"", axes=ax,
        branch_labels=lambda x:", ".join(map(lambda m: "%s%d%s"%m, x.mutations[:3]))
                               +('...' if len(x.mutations)>3 else ""))
```

## [[TreeTime]]

I found this curious section of code in the [[TreeTime|treetime examples]] scripts. It examines the correlation between [[branch stretch and the rate multiplier]]?

```python
    # Scatter branch stretch against the rate multiplier of the branch.
    # they are expected to have a positive correlation
    # 1) collect the optimal branch lenght (called mutation_length),
    #    the timetree branch length (clock_length) and the inferred rate multiplier gamma
    branch_lengths = []
    for n in tt_relaxed.tree.find_clades():
        if n.up:
            branch_lengths.append((n.mutation_length, n.clock_length, n.branch_length_interpolator.gamma))


    # 2) plot the difference between optimal and timetree branch length vs the rate multiplier
    plt.figure()
    branch_lengths = np.array(branch_lengths)
    plt.scatter(branch_lengths[:,0]-branch_lengths[:,1], branch_lengths[:,2])
    plt.xlabel("stretch")
    plt.ylabel("rate multiplier")
```

> Iteratively set branch lengths and reconstruct ancestral sequences until the values of either former or latter do not change. The algorithm assumes knowing only the topology of the tree, and requires that sequences are assigned to all leaves of the tree. The first step is to pre-reconstruct ancestral states using Fitch reconstruction algorithm or ML using existing branch length estimates. Then, optimize branch lengths and re-do reconstruction until convergence using ML method.

I seem to be having the issue that was supposed to have been fixed in v0.7.3 where the gap rate is set too high. I'm curious if I switch to a [[TN93]] model if that will help?

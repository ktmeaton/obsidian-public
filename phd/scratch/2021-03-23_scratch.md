# Meeting: Poinar Lab

- Cool ideas from lab members go here :)
- [[people/Emil-Karpsinki]] and [[people/Zachery-Dickson]] say go Bayesian! use Beast, estimate the tree topology alongside ancestral state reconstruction
- Ask Emil about beast2 book
- What are the packages I would want to use for BEAST2?
	- [[spreaD3]]
	- [[tools/mascot]] ([[muller2017StructuredCoalescentIts|Muller et al. 2017]])
- Experiment:
	- Try it on just #Clade/1-ORI 
	- #Discrete or #Continuous #Phylogeography ?

# General

- I did a little bit more #Obsidian research today. I watched [[Bryan-Jenks]]' [v0.10.5 review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUCMGw8uMRg&ab_channel=BryanJenks). Here I discovered the language [[tools/Mermaid|Mermaid]] to make flow charts.
- #kanban/backlog | Create methodology flowchart using [[Mermaid]].

- I'm playing with the ```query``` code block. I'd like to use it to link tasks from scratch in my [[Daily|Daily Notes Template]]

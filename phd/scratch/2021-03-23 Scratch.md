# Meeting: Poinar Lab

- Cool ideas from lab members go here :)
- [[Emil-Karpsinki]] and [[Zachery-Dickson]] say go Bayesian! use Beast, estimate the tree topology alongside ancestral state reconstruction
- Ask Emil about beast2 book
- What are the packages I would want to use for BEAST2?
	- [[spreaD3]]
	- [[mascot]] ([[muller2017StructuredCoalescentIts|Muller et al. 2017]])
- Experiment:
	- Try it on just [[Clade]] [[1.ORI]]
	- #Discrete or #Continuous [[Phylogeography]] ?

# Meeting: [[Ravneet-Sidhu]]
- The following tasks pertain to [[Plague Denmark]]:
	- #kanban/priority | #2021-03-24 | Danish samples through [[nf-core/eager]], [[Preseq]], and [[MultiQC]].
	- #kanban/priority | #2021-03-26 | [[Ravneet-Sidhu]] | Plan #pPCP1 resequencing.
	- #kanban/priority | #2021-03-26 |  Plan #Chromosome sequencing.
	- #kanban/todo | #2021-03-26 | Subsample fastq script.
	- #kanban/todo | #2021-03-26 | [[MultiQC]] Notes (example, how)
	- #kanban/todo | #2021-03-26 | [[snp-dists]] Notes (how, why)
	
# General

- I did a little bit more #Obsidian research today. I watched [[Bryan-Jenks]]' [v0.10.5 review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUCMGw8uMRg&ab_channel=BryanJenks). Here I discovered the language [[Mermaid|Mermaid]] to make flow charts.
- #kanban/backlog | Create methodology flowchart using [[Mermaid]].

- I'm playing with the ```query``` code block. I'd like to use it to link tasks from scratch in my [[Daily|Daily Notes Template]]

- I'm watching a [[Brian Jenks]] video and just learned about [[gruvbox color palette]]. I should try it out for some of my pixelart. But also download the obsidian theme.

- I also watched [[Brian Jenks]] video about integrating Zotero and Obsidian. I think it's worth a try. I'll need zotfile and the endnotes plugin.

- Tomorrow I should read what I want to, not what I should. Perhaps I'll try this with either a BEAST tutorial, or some docs for nf-core/eager or preset.

- I like how his graph view has his daily notes as a giant chain. I should add previous and next tags to the daily note. Maybe I could add this as a template. But there is the problem where there will be empty links for notes that don't exist. But I guess that's why there is the filter for existing slider.

- I realized that the gitjournal app does not display the filename in display. Only the first line I think.

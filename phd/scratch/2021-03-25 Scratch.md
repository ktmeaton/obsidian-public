I started the morning off by thinking of a new way to make notes on Mobile.

I tried using the app Termux to install git in the command line way. But I hit permissions errors. Termux only has rw permissions in it's install directory /data/.com.termux . So that's not going to work.

The git functionality of gitjournal is excellent, it's the "journal" part that is lacking. I changed settings in gitjournal to save the repo to an external location. I then downloaded the app markor and pointed it to that directory.

The edits I make in markor are detected by the editor in gitjournal. But git won't push he changes unless I make an edit in the gitjournal app. If I'm only editing one file, that's fine for now.

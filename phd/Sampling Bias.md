# Sampling Bias

Here I'm working on the concept of #Sampling-Bias from [[rasmussen2015EarlyDivergentStrains]].

## Methods

- #Bootstrap
- #Jacknife

## Notes

- I have an idea about variance saturation. #Bootstrap(ping) can continue until a threshold is met (more bootstraps do not produce a meaningful change). Does the same thing exist for #Jacknife and #Leave-One-Out analysis?

# Meet with Hendrik

[Meeting Link](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/86270641220?pwd=OWVGQy9DU3RjVFNrY3BwZHZmamthZz09)

## What are the 2-3 points of the [[plague-phylogeography]] paper?

### 1. How can the molecular clock of [[Yersinia pestis]] be modeled?
	- Large degree of rate variation.
	- A strict clock is questionable, but estimates are stable (with large variance).
	- A relaxed clock is more appropriate, but estimate are unstable.
	
--> Possibly more appropriate to use multiple models, separated by clade?

2. How can the molecular clock be applied?
	- Tip Dating  (ex. archaeological samples)
	- Node Dating (ex. splits, pandemics)

# Meet with Hendrik

[Meeting Link](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/86270641220?pwd=OWVGQy9DU3RjVFNrY3BwZHZmamthZz09)

#### 1. How can the molecular clock of [[Yersinia pestis]] be modeled?

- Large degree of rate variation.
- A strict clock is questionable, but estimates are stable (with large variance).
- A relaxed clock is more appropriate, but estimates are unstable.
	
--> Possibly more appropriate to use multiple models, separated by clade? 

#### 2. How can the molecular clock be applied?

- Tip Dating  (ex. archaeological samples)
- Node Dating (ex. splits, pandemics)

#### 3. Geography

- Case example of the second pandemic.

### Tasks

- [[tasks/Write New Outline]]
- "How does this shift dialogue?"

# Meet with Hendrik

## [[2021-05-04]]

[Meeting Link](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/81482109517?pwd=ampCZ3BIZzZQdUViWVhnL0lTakhsdz09)

## Notes

- Present the working draft [Nextstrain Narrative](https://nextstrain.org/community/narratives/ktmeaton/plague-phylogeography-projects@main/main).
- Paper Objectives:
	1. Critical examination of molecular clock models.
	2. Critique of phylogeography models.

- Give some context about the Y. pestis genome (chromosome, plasmids, genes), more context for plague the bacteria and genome.
- Great place to put in Pandemics context, and how many??? How are they defined?? Problems associated
- Why do we care about origins and timing?
- Context for why molecular clock is useful and applicable.
	- Contextualize the past, understand current pandemics and future.
- Why do we care about rate variation and what does it mean? Rate variation as an indicator of adaptation
- pla deletion/loss, human-associated adaptation?

- Rethink ordering of tree vs. models.
- Put number of subs on terminal branches
- Reread the pestis segunda and 
- Discuss the Big Bang Polytomy, and our ability to date or not date it.
- Ask Sebastian about their Big Bang

- Sampling Bias: Subsampling Second Pandemic down to show the instability
- Resampling again, how do we show the instablility. Understandable to the non-specialist

- Figure shematic, comparison left and right, same clade treated different.
- Discuss with Sebastian/Leo about the Country vs. Province geographic location.
- Send Second pandemic tree + map to Nukhet and Ann

#### 1. How can the molecular clock of [[Yersinia pestis]] be modeled?

- Large degree of rate variation.
- A strict clock is questionable, but estimates are stable (with large variance).
- A relaxed clock is more appropriate, but estimates are unstable.
	
--> Possibly more appropriate to use multiple models, separated by clade? 

#### 2. How can the molecular clock be applied?

- Tip Dating  (ex. archaeological samples)
- Node Dating (ex. splits, pandemics)

#### 3. Geography

- Case example of the second pandemic.

### Tasks

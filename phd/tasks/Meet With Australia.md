# Meet With Australia

## [[2021-05-06]]

[Meeting Link]()

## [[2021-04-26]]

[Meeting Link](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/84583403662?pwd=OWZpbVhmMVhLc1hJOGd0aVFEZEJRZz09)

### Preparation

#### 1. Datasets
1. Constructed two datasets based on samples that have [[Geographic Location]] and [[Date]]:
	- Full (n=600)
	- Reduced (n=200)

#### 2. [[Clock Model]]

##### Regression

#### 3. [[Phylogeography]]

##### [[Discrete]]

##### [[Continuous]]

1. Experimented with [[Continuous|continuous]] [[Phylogeography|phylogeography]] in [[BEAST2]].

### Notes

- Set up different priors on the mean rate
- No good mixing for the relaxed clock, for many of the parameters
- High values for the coefficient of variation (high rate variation)
- Fitting the rate variation to a model is really hard!	
- Strict clock: Setting different priors ends up the with similar/overlapping distributions. Not sensitive to prior!
- How do rates differ between strict and relaxed? Very different!
- Root heights differ (20,000 - 8,000 YBP)
- Need to make a lot of assumptions 

### Tasks
- [x] [[Send Starting Tree to Australia]]
- [x] [[Create Multiple Alignments by Clade]]
- [x] [[tasks/Send IBD Plots]]
- 
- Dating by clade (BETS analysis).
- Relative branch rates (genetic distance, 
- Relaxed clock, fit rate to 1, for phylogeography
- Visualized as a matrix
- Leave one out analysis


- BETS -> 	Leave One Out

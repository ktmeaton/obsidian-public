# Construct New Datasets

I've been struggling with this task for a few reasons.

1. Alignment filtering. I can filter alignments to include or remove singleton variants (occurring in only one sample).
	- For: Dramatically cleans up the temporal signal.
	- Against: Excludes uniquely derived mutations, which may be of interest.

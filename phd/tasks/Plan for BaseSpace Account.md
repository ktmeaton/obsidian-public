> Hi Everyone,
> 
> Following up from lab meeting, our Basespace Account for sequence data is full! Could everyone take a look to see if any of their sequencing projects can be safely removed (ex. published and hosted publicly on NCBI, ENA etc.)? Ideally, your data should be stored in 3 separate locations. That might be:
> 1. BaseSpace
> 1. Brian's Infoserv cluster.
> 1. External Hard Drive.
> 
> It's possible to make personal BaseSpace accounts, so I'm going to migrate some of my data off our group account. In the meantime, we can ponder a better solution. Some of my ideas are:
> 
> 1. Pay for more space on BaseSpace?
> 1. Secure access to another data storage service (McMaster HPC)?

> Cheers,

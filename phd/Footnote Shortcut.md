# Footnote Shortcut

## Summary

Footnote Shortcut that adds footnotes.

## Functions

After installing and activating this plugin, you still have to SET UP your hotkey. This is easy and quick:

`Settings -> Hotkeys -> Search for "Footnote" -> Customize Command -> Your preferred hotkey`

I personally use Command+Shift+6 because "6" on a US keyboard is where the uptick/footnote character "^" is.

## Test

Whoops, here's something new [^3]!This is an important sentence that I want to reference [^1]. I've got something else to cite [^2].
[^1]: This reference was cited first.
[^2]: Yet another footnote.
[^3]: Another footnote, but at the beginning!

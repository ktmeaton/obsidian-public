## Introduction

The [[Geographic Origin|geographic origin]] and [[Spread|spread]] of pathogens can be reconstructed using [[Phylogeography|phylogeography]]. This approach combines [[Phylogenetic|genetic]] data with [[Geospatial|spatial]] and [[Temporal|temporal]] information, such as the sampling location and date. This accessory information is modeled as an [[Evolution|evolutionary]] process alongside the phylogeny, which can then be used to estimate the timing and location of historical events ([[Kalkauskas et al. 2021 Sampling Bias Model|Kalkauskas et al. 2021]]).

However, there remains a central tension in the field of [[phylogeography]] over the appropriate use of this analytical technique. On one hand, [[phylogeography]] is frequently employed as a *discovery* technique to test hypotheses about organisms or events for which there is little prior information.  This framework is typical of [[Ancient DNA|ancient DNA]] studies, where a [[phylogeny]] is constructed from rare ancient specimens. This technique has been used to estimate when and where bacterial diseases first emerged such as plague, syphilis, and tuberculosis ([[Rascovan et al. 2019 Emergence Spread Basal|Rascovan et al. 2019]]; [[Majander et al. 2020 Ancient Bacterial Genomes|Majander et al. 2020]]; [[Sabin 2020 Seventeenth-Century Mycobacterium Tuberculosis|Sabin et al. 2020]]). In these examples, the purpose of [[Phylogeography|phylogeography]] is to generate novel insight where other forms of evidence, such as historical documents, are limited.

On the other side of this tension, is the argument that [[phylogeography]] is a *complementary* technique which requires robust prior knowledge and context. [[Faria et al. 2018 Genomic Epidemiological Monitoring|Faria et al. (2018)]] demonstrated the analytical and interpretive risks associated with using only [[Phylogenetic|phylogenetic]] data to reconstruct the spread of a [[Yellow Fever Virus|Yellow Fever Virus]] outbreak. These risks derived from significant [[Sampling Bias|sampling bias]], specifically [[Under-represented|undersampling]] of [[non-human]] hosts. Similarly, [[Kalkauskas et al. 2021 Sampling Bias Model|Kalkauskas et al. (2021)]] demonstrated how [[Under-represented|undersampling]] key geographic regions could significantly shift the geographic origin of [[West Nile Virus]] in the [[United Statest of America|USA]].

So what does this mean for [[Ancient DNA|ancient DNA]] researchers who have limited 
Fortunately, there is 

The integration of [[Sequence-Free|sequence-free]] evidence has only been applied to the study of viruses, and furthermore, to outbreaks occurring over a relatively small geographic range and time period. It is unknown whether this approach is useful for bacterial [[phylogeography]]

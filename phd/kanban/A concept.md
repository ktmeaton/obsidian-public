# A new useful concept
- [[Saini (2017) – Inferior]] described it like this, but [[Csikszentmihalyi (2008) – Flow]] described it like that.

This link appears many times,[^repeated] so uses a footnote. A reference[^repeated] had an even different idea to [[Csikszentmihalyi (2008) – Flow]]. 

This concept only appeared once, so just paste link.

[[Julia Gamble]] has a good idea about this, but [[Hendrik Poinar]] thinks that this is wrong. I need to check.[^repeated]

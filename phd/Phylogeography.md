# Phylogeography

## Summary

This page explores [[Phylogeography]], particularly the [[Geographic Origin]](s) and [[Spread|migration]] of human pathogens. It concerns discussions in the literature, and methods of reconstruction.

## Projects

- [[plague-phylogeography]]
- [[Plague Denmark]]

## Methods

- [[Mugration]] ([[Discrete|discrete]])
- [[Brownian-Motion]] ([[Continuous|continuous]])

## Tools

- [[TreeTime]]
- [[BEAST]]
- [[spreaD3]]

## Literature

- [[Genome]]-based models of [[Yersinia pestis]] have not been grounded with [[Geospatial|geospatial]] [[Statistics]]. An example from [[Guellil et al. 2020 Genomic Historical Synthesis]]:

- It's uncertain what data is being used to construct this map. I think mostly historical, but perhaps also the genomic evidence?
